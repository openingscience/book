abstract: "“To make progress in science, we need to be open and share.” This quote
from Neelie Kroes (2012), vice president of the European Commission
describes the growing public demand for an Open Science. Part of Open
Science is, next to Open Access to peer-reviewed publications, the Open
Access to research data, the basis of scholarly knowledge. The
opportunities and challenges of Data Sharing are discussed widely in the
scholarly sector. The cultures of Data Sharing differ within the
scholarly disciplines. Well advanced are for example disciplines like
biomedicine and earth sciences. Today, more and more funding agencies
require a proper Research Data Management and the possibility of data
re-use. Many researchers often see the potential of Data Sharing, but
they act cautiously. This situation shows a clear ambivalence between
the demand for Data Sharing and the current practice of Data Sharing.
Starting from a baseline study on current discussions, practices and
developments the article describe the challenges of Open Research Data.
The authors briefly discuss the barriers and drivers to Data Sharing.
Furthermore, the article analyses strategies and approaches to promote
and implement Data Sharing. This comprises an analysis of the current
landscape of data repositories, enhanced publications and data papers.
In this context the authors also shed light on incentive mechanisms,
data citation practises and the interaction between data repositories
and journals. In the conclusions the authors outline requirements of a
future Data Sharing culture."

##1. The Vision of Open Research Data

Digitization has opened up new possibilities for scientists in their
handling of information and knowledge. The potential of networked
research was recorded in the “Berlin Declaration on Open Access to
Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities” (2003). This declaration was
signed by leading scientific organizations and is regarded as the
central reference for the demands of access and sharing of scientific
results in the digital age. Previous definitions of Open Access were
related to free access to peer-reviewed
literature [^1], whereas the
“Berlin Declaration” considers this in a wider sense. Not only articles,
but also “raw data and metadata, source materials, digital
representations of pictorial and graphical materials and scholarly
multimedia material” should be openly accessible and usable.

This demand is also evident on the political level. An example is the
statement made in a publication of the [Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD)](http://oecd.org/dataoecd/9/61/38500813.pdf) 2007, entitled “Principles and
Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding”: “Sharing
and Open Access to publicly funded research data not only helps to
maximise the research potential of new digital technologies and
networks, but provides greater returns from the public investment in
research (OECD 2007). The European
Commission also strives for open access to research data. In the
“Commission Recommendation on Access to and Preservation of Scientific
Information” which was published in 2012, European member states are
requested to ensure that “research data that result from publicly funded
research become publicly accessible, usable and re-usable through
digital e-infrastructures” [@european_commission_2012a].

The discussion on the realisation of this aim is present in the
scientific communities [@nature_2002; @nature_2005; @nature_2009a; @nature_2009b;
@science_2011]. The term Open Research Data can be applied
on a cross-disciplinary layer. It covers the heterogeneity of the data
with its diverse characteristics, forms and formats in the scientific
disciplines. Further to this, the term Open Research Data is distinct to
Open Data, which is mainly used in the context of Open Government
initiatives and neglects the special requirements of science.

The two central arguments for Open Access to research data are a) the
possibility to re-use data in a new connection and b) the verifiability
it guarantees for ensuring good scientific practice. The OECD (2007)
added a further argument: “Sharing and Open Access to publicly funded
research data not only helps to maximise the research potential of new
digital technologies and networks, but provides greater returns from the
public investment in research.”

The vision of the High Level Expert Group on Scientific Data for the year
2030 is that, scientists in their role as data user, “are able to find,
access and process the data they need”, and in their role as data producer
“prefer to deposit their data with confidence in reliable repositories”
[@high_level_expert_group_on_scientific_data_2010].

The demand for Open Research Data effects individual researchers and
their data handling. In a report of The Royal Society [@royal_society_2012] entitled
“Science as an open enterprise“ which is worth reading, the
recommendation is given that: “[s]cientists should communicate the data
they collect and the models they create, to allow free and Open Access,
and in ways that are intelligible, assessable and usable for other
specialists in the same or linked fields wherever they are in the world.
Where data justify it, scientists should make them available in an
appropriate data repository. Where possible, communication with a wider
public audience should be made a priority, and particularly so in areas
where openness is in the public interest.” This recommendation makes it
clear that diverse basic conditions must be created before Data Sharing
can become a standard in scientific practice. Access and usage
conditions must be defined. Murray-Rust et al. [^2] for example demands
the free accessibility in the public domain in their “Panton
Principles”: “By open data in science we mean that it is freely
available on the public Internet permitting any user to download, copy,
analyse, re-process, pass them to software or use them for any other
purpose without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those
inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself.” The majority of
the disciplines are still far away from the implementation of these
“[p]rinciples for open data in science”, however. In addition, there are
many cases in the life sciences and social science disciplines in which,
because of data protection and personal rights, Data Sharing is not
possible, or only possible under narrowly defined conditions.

##2. The Status of Data Sharing Today

In a consultation carried out in 2012, the European Commission
determined that there were massive access barriers to research data. Of
the 1,140 of those questioned, 87 % contradicted the statement that “there
is no access problem to research data in Europe” [@european_commission_2012b].
In a revealing study made by Tenopir et al. [@tenopir_2011], 67 % of the
more than 1,300 researchers pointed to a “lack of access to data
generated by other researchers or institutions” that is a hindrance to
advances in science. Scientists frequently see the potential offered by
Open Research Data, but most are reticent with regard to the open
accessibility of their own data. Tenopir et al. found, for example, that
“only about a third (36 %) of the respondents agreed that others can
access their data easily”. This is not in accordance with the
researchers attitudes, as three-quarters state that they “share their
data with others”. The study also sheds light on different disciplinary
practices: Whereas 90 % of scientists working in atmospheric science were
agreeable to sharing their data, only 58 % of the questioned social
sciences scientists were ready to do this. The authors conclude: “there
is a willingness to share data, but it is difficult to achieve or is
done only on request.”

Further insights in disciplinary practices are presented by the studies
Wicherts et al. [-@wicherts_2006] in psychology and Savage and Vickers [-@savage_2009] in
medicine, for example. Wicherts et al. approached authors of 141
articles published in 2004 in journals of the American Psychological
Association (APA) and requested access to data that was the basis of the
articles. Within the next six months, they only received positive
replies from one third of the authors, 73 % of the authors were not
prepared to share their data. Savage & Vickers came to a similar result.
They asked authors of ten articles that were published in the PLoS
Medicine or PLoS Clinical Trials journals to allow them access to the
underlying data of the articles. Despite the clear demands for Open Access to
data in den editorial policies of each of the Open Access journals, only
one author permitted access to the requested data. A further insight in
the status of Data Sharing is presented by the analysis of Campbell et al.
[-@campbell_2002] in genetics. In this study that involved about 1,800 life science
scientists, they identified two central factors that hinder Data
Sharing: “Lack of resources and issues of scientific priority play an
important role in scientists' decisions to withhold data, materials, and
information from other academic geneticists.”

Alongside these very reserved attitudes, however, there are numerous
examples which underline that open exchange of research data can
successfully be realized. The “Bermuda Principles” that were adopted in
human genetics in the framework of the Human Genome Project in 1996, for
example. These principles require that “[a]ll human genomic sequence
data generated by centers funded for large-scale human sequencing should
be freely available and in the public domain to encourage research and
development and to maximize the benefit to society” [@smith_1996].
Over time the pre-publication of data comes off as common
practice, i.e. gene sequencies are made openly accessible prior to the
description of them in a peer reviewed article.[^3] Alongside Data
Sharing in large scientific projects, in which data is made openly
available in trustworthy research data repositories, there are also
examples of spontaneous Data Sharing. Research on a disease-causing
strain of the Escherichia coli (O104:H4) bacteria is such a case. This
caused more than 4,000[^4] people to fall ill in Germany in 2011. The
publication of sequence data under a Creative Commons licence and the
use of the widely popular GitHub[^5] as an exchange platform enabled
scientists all over the world to make a contribution to a rapid
investigation of the bacterium [@kupferschmidt_2011; @turner_2011; @check_hayden_2012].

A further example of successful Data Sharing is the operation of the
World Data System (WDS) of the International Council of Science (ICSU)
which — even before the coming into being of the Internet — resulted from
the International Geophysical Year (1957–1958). This network of
disciplinary data centers ensures “full, open, timely,
non-discriminatory and unrestricted access to metadata, data, products
and services”[^6].

##3. Understanding the Barriers

So-called data policies have an increasing effect on scientists and how
they handle research data.[^7] Recommendations and mandatory
requirements by funding agencies and scientific journals stand out here.
They request the beneficiary of funds to ensure the preservation and
accessibility of data created in the framework of a funded project or a
publication. The National Institute of Health (NIH) was a pioneer in this
respect. It anchored its “Data Sharing Policy” in 2003: Applicants for a
grant upwards of 500,000 US dollar are requested to make statements on
Data Sharing[^8]. From 2011 on, the National Science Foundation (NSF)
requires receivers of funds “to share with other researchers, at no more
than incremental cost and within a reasonable time, the primary data,
samples, physical collections and other supporting materials created or
gathered in the course of work under NSF grants” [@national_science_foundation_2011a].
Measures for the implementation of this guideline
must be specified in a “Data Management Plan” [@national_science_foundation_2011b].
This request is being increasingly taken up by
scientific journals via editorial policies. Exemplary for these are the
requirements of the Nature journals, in which “authors are required to
make materials, data and associated protocols promptly available to
readers without undue qualifications in material transfer agreements”.
It is suggested that the data be made accessible “via public
repositories" [^9].

It must be noted that implementation of the requirements formulated in
the data policies will not run by itself [@pampel_2011]. To
promote Data Sharing it is necessary to identify the barriers, which
influence scientists with regard to the sharing of their own data.
Surveys carried out by Kuipers and Van der Hoeven [@kuipers_2009] and Tenopir et
al. [@tenopir_2011] allow the following barriers to be named: “legal issues”,
“misuse of data” and “incompatible data types” [@kuipers_2009],
as well as “insufficient time” and “lack of funding” [@tenopir_2011].
These barriers make it clear that a dedicated framework is
required for the publication of research data. The conception and
implementation of such a framework is being increasingly discussed under
the Research Data Management term[^10]. The aim is to develop
organisational and technical measure to ensure a trustworthy
infrastructure for permanent integrity and re-use of data. The centre of
attention hereby is the operation of information infrastructures, such
as research data repositories, in which research data can be permanently
stored. To make re-use of the stored data possible, the Research Data
Management framework must ensure that the data are described via
metadata. Documentation of the instruments and methods used to obtain
the data is necessary for reliable re-use of the data, for example. Such
an enhanced documentation of data is often a time-consuming task that is
competing with many other activities on the researchers priority list.
Further to this, in many disciplines there are no standards in which the
data can be described.

Recently, it can be observed that libraries, data centers and other
institutions are increasingly collaborate and begin to build up
information infrastructures to support scientists in the handling of
their data and so also to promote Data Sharing [@pampel_2010;
@osswald_2012; @reilly_2012].

Van der Graaf and Waaijers [@graaf_2011] have formulated four central fields of
action for the realization of a “collaborative data infrastructure”
which enables the “use, re-use and exploit research data to the maximum
benefit of science and society”. Incentives must be given to stimulate
Data Sharing (1); in addition, the education and training of scientists
and service providers on and around the handling of data must be
intensified (2). Further to these the authors point to the importance on
the structuring and networking of research data infrastructures that
serve for a permanent and reliable data storage (3) and point out the
challenge of the long-term financing of these infrastructures (4).

##4. Overcoming the Barriers

A central barrier to of the pervasiveness of Data Sharing is the lack of
incentives for the individual scientist to make his data openly
accessible. In particular in projects, in which data management was not
already discussed in the preparatory phase, the individual scientist has
good reasons for not making his or her data openly accessible, as there
are no incentive mechanisms for the sharing of research data in the
competitive scientific system [@borgman_2010; @klump_2012].

The slogan “[c]redit where credit is overdue” [@nature_biotechnology_2009]
clearly expresses that: Data Sharing will only be successful when
it is worthwhile for a scientist to make his data openly accessible.
Against this background, a growing number of publication strategies are
appearing with a view to the implementation of Data Sharing on the basis
of the established scientific reputation system. Three of these
strategies are as follows[^11]:

1.  The publication of research data as an independent information
    object in a research data repository.
2.  The publication of research data as a textual documentation in the
    form of a so-called data paper.
3.  The publication of research data as enrichment of an article, a
    so-called “enriched publication”.

Whereas the first named practice has long been established in the life
sciences with the use of data repositories such as GenBank [@benson_2012]
[^12], the second named data paper strategy has been gaining
more and more attention recently. Chavan and Penev [@chavan_2011] define this
publication type as follows: “a journal publication whose primary
purpose is to describe data, rather than to report a research
investigation. As such, it contains facts about data, not hypotheses and
arguments in support of those hypotheses based on data, as found in a
conventional research article.” Experience with data papers has been
made, among others, in the geosciences[^13] and ecology[^14]. The use of
this model has recently been widened to include so-called data journals.
The pioneer of this development is the Open Access journal Earth System
Science Data (ESSD). It has published descriptions of geosciences data
sets since 2008. The data sets themselves are published on a “reliable
repository” [@pfeiffenberger_2011]. The data sets and
descriptive publications described are permanently persistently
addressed by means of a digital object identifier (DOI) which also
facilitate data citation. Thanks to this procedure that was developed
within the Publication and Citation of Scientific Primary Data (STD-DOI)
project [@klump_2006] and expanded by DataCite [@brase_2011],
it is possible to link publications and the underlying data.
This procedure also supports the visibility of the data. Some publishing
houses, for example, have therefore already integrated freely accessible
research data in their platforms [@reilly_2011]. A number of data
journals have been brought into being in the meantime.[^15] It must be
noted here that the establishment of data journals is only feasible when
data, metadata and the corresponding text publication are freely accessible,
as only then can a barrier free re-use of the data be possible.

The linking of articles and data is also addressed in the third named
enriched publication strategy [@woutersen-windhouwer_2009]. The
aim is build and sustain a technical environment to to relate all relevant
information objects around an article so that a knowledge space is
created, in which the research data that are the basis of the article
can be made freely accessible.[^16]

The implementation of the three strategies requires trustworthy
repositories on which the data can be made permanently accessible. A
differentiation must be made here between institutional, disciplinary,
multi-disciplinary and project-specific infrastructure [@pampel_2013].
Prominent examples of disciplinary research data repositories are
GenBank in genetics and PANGAEA in geosciences and Dryad in biodiversity
research.[^17] A look at the access conditions of repositories
highlights some differences: GenBank states that there are “no
restrictions on the use or distribution of the GenBank data, PANGAEA
licences the data under the “Creative Commons Licence Attribution” and
Dryad makes the data accessible under the “Creative Commons License CC0”
in the public domain.

A number of studies have been published that show the impact of Data
Sharing on citation rates. Articles for which the underlying data is
shared are more frequently cited than articles for which this is not the
case. This is substantiated in studies from genetics [@piwowar_2007; @botstein_2010],
astronomy [@henneken_2011; @dorch_2012]
and paleoceanography [@sears_2011]. Such results need to be considered
when discussing the lack of incentives for Data Sharing. The same holds
true for data citation and data papers, which could contribute to the
researchers publication profile and thus current research assessments
and incentive systems.

##5. Translating Vision into Practice

The developments in recent years have shown that numerous initiatives
have emerged in Data Sharing. The hesitation among researchers in many
disciplines is met by new strategies that work on barriers such as the
lack of incentives. A professionalization of the Research Data
Management, which supports scientists in the sharing of their data, is
necessary to ensure the permanent accessibility, however. In this
context, priority must be given to the structuring and
networking of the research data repositories and their long-term
financing.

A more detailed analysis for the identification and overcoming of
barriers to Data Sharing has been created in the framework of the
EU-project [Opportunities for Data Exchange (ODE)](http://ode-project.eu)[^18]. This project takes the various players
involved in scholarly communication and data management (policy-makers, funders, researchers, research and education
organisations, data centres and infrastructure service providers and
publishers) in the economic system into consideration, names variables
that have an effect on the sharing and points out strategies for
overcoming barriers to Open Access [@dallmeier-tiessen_2012]. Many
of the strategies that are outlined show that, to counter the diverse
challenges, close cooperation is necessary between the players named
above. As an example, the successful implementation of data policies of
supporting organizations requires a Research Data Management and
infrastructures that support scientists and create a regulatory
framework. All of these measures will only lead to success, however,
when scholarly societies and other disciplinary players who support the
anchoring in the disciplinary communities take part. All players in the
scientific process are therefore requested to make their contribution to
Open Access of research data.

The publication strategies outlined show that there really is a
possibility for the anchoring of Data Sharing in the scientific
reputation system. Further innovation is desirable, though. The
implementation of the increasing demand for Open Science from
society[^19] and academic policy [@kroes_2012], as is assumed, for
example, by the federation of national academies ALLEA — ALL European
Academies [@all_european_academies_2012], needs a culture of sharing. The establishment of this
culture is a far reaching challenge. It appears that implementation of
it can only then be successful when changes are made in the scientific
reputation system. Scientific performances should in future be valued
with a “sharing factor” that not only judges the citation frequency in
the scientific community, but also rates the implementation of sharing
of information and knowledge for the good of society.

The demand for openness in science is loud and clear. All players in the
scientific area should direct their practices to this demand. The
publication strategies for research data have up to now been important
approaches towards Open Science. The following citation from the “Berlin
Declaration” (2003) makes it clear, that further steps are
necessary for the realization of Open Science: “Our mission of
disseminating knowledge is only half complete if the information is not
made widely and readily available to society.”
