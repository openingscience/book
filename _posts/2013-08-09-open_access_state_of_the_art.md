## Abstract

Free access to knowledge is a central module within the context of
Science 2.0. Rapid development within the area of Open Access underlines
this fact and is a pathfinder for Science 2.0, especially since the
October 2003 enactment of the [“Berlin Declaration on Open Access to
Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities”](http://http://oa.mpg.de/files/2010/04/berlin_declaration.pdf).

## Introduction

The past years have shown that Open Access is of high relevance for all
scientific areas but it is important to see that the implementation is
subject-tailored. In all journal based sciences two both
well-established and complementary ways used are “OA gold” and “OA
green”. These two ways offer various advantages that enhance scientific
communication’s processes by allowing free access to information for
everybody at any time.

Furthermore, it is necessary to break new ground in order to expand,
optimize, and ensure free worldwide access to knowledge in the long run.
All involved players need to re-define their role and position in the
process. This challenge will lead to new, seminal solutions for the
sciences.

## Definition of Open Access

Open Access implies free access to scientific knowledge for everybody.
In the “Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences
and Humanities“, the term scientific knowledge is defined as “ original
scientific research results, raw data and metadata, source materials,
digital representations of pictorial and graphical materials and
scholarly multimedia
material[".](http://oa.mpg.de/files/2010/04/berlin_declaration.pdf) Most scientific knowledge is gained in a publicly funded context;
basically it is paid for by the taxpayer. In many fields, journals are
the main channel of scholarly communication, therefore Open Access has
especially developed in this sector. At the moment, most scientific
journal articles are only accessible to scientists who are working in an
institution with a library that has licensed the content. According to
the “Berlin Declaration”, not only a “free, irrevocable, worldwide,
right of access” should be granted, but also a “license to copy, use,
distribute, transmit and display the work publicly and to make and
distribute derivative works, in any digital medium for any
responsible purpose (…) as well as the right to make small numbers of
printed copies for their personal[".](http://oa.mpg.de/files/2010/04/berlin_declaration.pdf)

Authors have several possibilities in publishing their research results.
Open Access maximizes the visibility and outreach of the authors’
publications and the results of public funding (Figure 1).

## State of the Art

Open Access today is an accepted and applauded scientific publication
strategy. In summer 2012, a number of statements impressively showed the
state of the art as it was seen by national and international actors of
science politics and science management.

The European Commission published its vision on how to improve access to
scientific information. Two citations from this occasion’s press release
and the related communication represent this perspective:

*“As a first step, the Commission will make open access to scientific
publications a general principle of Horizon 2020, the EU’s Research &
Innovation funding program for 2014-2020. As of 2014, all articles
produced with funding from Horizon 2020 will have to be accessible:
articles will either immediately be made accessible online by the
publisher (‘Gold’ open access)—up-front publication costs can be
eligible for reimbursement by the European Commission; or researchers
will make their articles available through an open access repository no
later than six months (12 months for articles in the fields of social
sciences and humanities) after publication (‘Green’ open
access)”* (see [Press Releases RAPID](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-790_en.htm)).

*“The European Commission emphasises open access as a key tool to bring
together people and ideas in a way that catalyses science and
innovation. To ensure economic growth and to address the societal
challenges of the 21st century, it is essential to optimize the
circulation and transfer of scientific knowledge among key stakeholders
in European research—universities, funding bodies, libraries, innovative
enterprises, governments and policy-makers, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) and society at large.”*[^1]

Hence, we can expect that results from the European research program
Horizon 2020 should be fully open access. Already in the current
program, published results from the fields of energy, environment,
health, information and communication technologies, and research
infrastructures are expected to be open access, according to an Open
Access Pilot for these subjects.

“…*beneficiaries* shall deposit an electronic copy of the published
version or the final manuscript accepted for publication of a scientific
publication relating to *foreground* published before or after the
final report in an institutional or subject-based repository at the
moment of publication. *Beneficiaries* are required to make their best
efforts to ensure that this electronic copy becomes freely and
electronically available to anyone through this repository:

-   immediately if the scientific publication is published “open
    access”, i.e. if an electronic version is also available free of
    charge via the publisher, or
-   within [X] months of publication […”](http://ec.europa.eu/research/press/2008/pdf/annex_1_new_clauses.pdf)

In June 2012, the Royal Society published a report named “Science as an
open enterprise” which aimed for research data to be an integral part of
every researcher’s scientific record, stressing the close connection of
open publication and open accessible research data (see Chapter 14,
Pampel & Dallmeier-Tiessen: Open Research Data)*.* “Open inquiry is at
the heart of scientific enterprise … We are now on the brink of an
achievable aim: for all science literature to be online, for all of the
data to be online and for the two to be interoperable” (Boulton 2012).

In several countries, initiatives are afoot to build a legal foundation
to help broadening the road to a world of openly accessible scientific
results. Just to name a few:

-   In Great Britain, the minister for universities and science, David
    Willetts, strongly supports a shift to free access to academic
    research. The British government actually plans to open access to
    all publicly funded research by 2014 (cf. Willetts 2012).
-   In the United States, an initiative called Federal Research Public
    Access Act (FRPAA) is on the way, requiring "[free online public
    access](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/Notes_on_the_Federal_Research_Public_Access_Act)“.
-   In Germany, the Alliance of German Science Organizations is a strong
    supporter of an initiative for a change in German Copyright law
    which is supposed to secure a basic right for authors to publish
    their findings in accordance to the idea of providing scientists
    free access to information (see [Priority Initiative “Digital Information”](http://www.allianzinitiative.de/en/core_activities/legal_frameworks)).

Since the [Budapest Open Access Initiative](http://www.soros.org/openaccess/read) (BOAI
2002) was inaugurated, a number
of declarations of different bodies have paved the way. Indeed, the list
of signatories of the “[Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in
the Sciences and
Humanities](http://oa.mpg.de/files/2010/04/berlin_declaration.pdf)”
read like a gazetteer of scientific institutions and organizations
worldwide.

Due to a series of follow-up conferences, the number of supporters of
the Berlin Declaration is still growing. Moreover, some US universities
took the opportunity to join in when the [conference](http://www.berlin9.org) took place
Washington DC in December 2011.

Already at an early stage, funding bodies like the [National Institutes
of Health (NIH)](http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm) stepped in and created
rules for the openness of their funded research. National funders like
DFG in Germany, SURF in the Netherlands, JISC in GB, and others not only
asked for open results of their funded projects, but also featured
change by funding calls for projects to do research on Open Access and
to develop appropriate infrastructure.

One of the boosters for this rapid development of support for Open
Access was, of course, the “journal crisis”. Since the early 1990’s, we
have seen a dramatic change in the scientific publication landscape,
especially for journals which had basically not changed since they were
established. One other aspect was a long series of mergers of
publication houses, leaving us with four big players controlling about
60 to 70 percent of journal titles worldwide. Here, stock exchange
perspectives and risk money from private equity funds are playing an
important and shaping role. Another change factor lies in the
possibilities of the Internet. Already in the early days of the
Internet, [ArXiv](http://arxiv.org) was established. ArXiv already displayed the benefits of Open
Access within a small, and for a long time closely cooperating
community, Particle Physics. Publishers used their monopoly and
increased journal prices over the years at very high rates; at least 10
percent per year was the standard for years. Although these rates have
lowered a little in the last few years (five to six percent per year),
since the late nineties, most libraries have had problems keeping up
with the subscriptions to journals which they should hold for the
benefit of researchers. As a result, they have cancelled journal
subscriptions. Even today, big and famous libraries cancel journal
subscriptions, like the Faculty Advisory Council suggested for Harvard
in 2012.[^2] In former days, moderate prices guaranteed that, at least
in the Western world, the possibility somehow of providing access to
scientific output. In these times of a continuing “journal crisis”,
fewer and fewer scientists get access to journals, especially in
science, technology, and medicine, and therewith to scientific
knowledge, because not all institutions can afford the ever rising
subscription fees. This day to day experience of many scientists
enormously helped to build the vision of science based on openly
accessible publications.

In economic theory, Nobel laureate Elinor Ostrom extended her concept of
“the commons” to also include “understanding knowledge as a commons”
(Hess & Ostrom 2011). Open access activist Peter Suber showed how Open
Access fits perfectly in such a theoretical background: “Creating an
Intellectual Commons through Open Access” (Suber 2011).

Interviews with scientists showed that a change in attitude has already
taken place. More and more scientists admit that they quickly change to
another content related, but accessible article if they experience
access problems. Also, Open Access seems to be a modern prolongation of
a central traditional scientific habit for many scientists: make your
work accessible to colleagues. This was done in former times with the
help of offprints. Open access to an article may be seen as a modern
solution for such scientific needs.

Some numbers show how broad the idea of open access is, how many already
are using Open Access, and how quickly it is still growing. ["Base"](http://www.base-search.net),
a service built by the University Library Bielefeld, is harvesting the
world of repositories (Green Open Access) and indexing their contents.
It now contains over 35 million items, which compares to a total of
about 1 million collected items in 2005.[^3]  [The Directory of Open
Access Journals (DOAJ)](http://www.doaj.org) gives an overview of Open Access
Journals (Gold Open Access). In 2002, they counted 33 journals.
Currently, the steadily increasing number has reached more than 8000
open access journals (Figure 2).

![**Figure 2**. Number of Open Access journals by year (Source: DOAJ).](/images/open_access_2.png)

“Green” and “Gold” are the two well established and complimentary used
roads to Open Access. Open Access depends upon these basic concepts,
but, of course, a number of mixed concepts have also been established
(for detailed information see Suber 2012).

## A Closer Look at Green and Gold Open Access

Traditional journal subscription denies access to all those whose
institution cannot afford to pay yearly subscription fees. In contrast,
Gold Open Access describes a business model for journal publishing which
gives free access to all potential readers and sees other models to
cover expenses for a publication. Although there is a broad range of
models, a majority of notable Open Access journals rely on publication
fees, also known as article processing charges (ACP), which are often
also incorrectly referred to as author fees. These sums are usually paid
by the author’s institution. Especially in science, technology, and
medicine, this follows the practice of paying for color images, too many
pages, or other factors, which has been familiar since pre-Internet
times in subscription-based journals. On the other hand, society
journals in particular have opened access to their journal articles
without charging authors. Others, like PNAS, give access after an
embargo of half a year.

In the early times of Open Access an often heard argument against golden
journals was the question of quality. Open Access journals differ only
in terms of the publisher’s business model from subscription-based
journals; they pass through the same peer review processes as the
traditional journals and there are no differences regarding the quality
of the published articles. Newly founded journals need some time to
build a positive resonance in their research community. Today, Open
Access journals are, of course, embedded within the high ranking
journals in their fields. More and more get listed, e.g. in the Journal
Citation Report of *Thomson-Reuters* (more than ten percent of all
ranked titles).[^4] Laakso et al. (2011) give a comprehensive overview
of the development using a distinction between “The pioneering years
(1993–1999), the innovation years (2000–2004), and the consolidation
years (2005–2009)”. For the future a more numerous migration from
existing and valued subscription journals to the Gold model is
desirable.

However, Open Access is not only possible for articles in journals with
these respective business models. The Green Road of Open Access stresses
the possibility of authors to deposit their articles, which are
primarily published on publisher’s sites, additionally on another
server. Usually an institutional or a subject-based repository is used
for this purpose. “A complete version of the work and all supplemental
materials, including a copy of the permission as stated above, in an
appropriate standard electronic format is deposited (and thus published)
in at least one online repository using suitable technical standards”
([Berlin
Declaration](http://oa.mpg.de/files/2010/04/berlin_declaration.pdf)). An institutional repository is organized by an institution and contains
the publications of its scientists. Opposed to the affiliation to an
institution as a criterion for content, a subject-based repository
comprises publications which belong to some specific fields of science.
A famous example of a subject-based repository is
[ArXiv](http://arxiv.org) which already laid the
grass roots for Open Access in the nineties.
[PubMedCentral](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc) is another example within the
field of biomedical and life sciences research.

In principle, between 70 and 80 % of scientific journals allow such a
method of self-archiving. Generally there are some restrictions which
have to be complied by the authors. In the majority of cases, depositing
a version of the original article is not allowed, but rather a preprint
or a version of the final draft. Depending on the journal, this can
either be done immediately, or an embargo period between the publication
of the original article and the self-archiving has to be considered.
This period is usually between six (for STM journals) and twelve months
(for social sciences and humanities journals). All journals which allow
self-archiving are listed in the [SHERPA/Romeo](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo) database which also lists
the specific restrictions.

Meanwhile, many scientific institutions run an institutional repository
to deposit green open access articles*.* Usually the library is
responsible for this task. The deposit of their articles in such a
repository has numerous advantages for the scientists.

One large benefit is made up of the support the repository operator
offers its users. The scientists in question may ask for advice in all
questions concerning the workflow of posting their publications. This
includes, for example, when and in which form there are allowed to
deposit a journal article. Digital preservation of the stored material
is ensured as soon as explicit identification like persistent
identifiers is provided. Furthermore, they make sure that all
publications are tagged with precise and standardized metadata. Only in
this way is cross-linking with other sources or other repositories
possible, and, in turn, future features like semantic web functions will
be possible. Correctly prepared data also enhances search engine
exposure. In future, the linking between publications and the data which
belongs to them, for example supplementary material or research data,
will be relatively easy to establish on this level.

The content of an institutional repository is not limited to journal
articles. By posting all of their publications, like reports, talks,
conference proceedings, teaching materials, and so forth, into the
repository, the scientists can present their work openly as a whole
within the context of their research group and institution.'' *If this
open access repository is combined with an institutional research
information system (CRIS), numerous benefits can emerge.* ''Authors can
re-use this content by linking to their openly accessible publications
from social networks for scientists, their own homepage, etc. Through
this linking, it is possible to connect the advantages of an
institutional repository with the scientist’s personal needs. It can
also be used as a helpful tool for the management of publications.

Scientists should demand such a database from their institutions if such
a service is not yet offered. Not only the scientists in question, but
also the whole institution benefit from a well-run institutional
repository. A presentation of the research output of an institution in
this way can constitute an important element for science marketing. For
example, a Google search on articles shows the institutional homepage
with the repository output, instead of a publisher’s homepage. It hence
serves as a showcase of the research output of an institution (cf.
Armbruster & Romery 2010). Therefore, it should also be in their
interest to build such systems.

Institutional repositories mostly deal with final drafts.
Subject-oriented repositories are based on specific traditions in
certain scientific fields. Surely the most famous is
[ArXiv](http://arxiv.org), founded in the early
nineties for researchers in Theoretical Physics. Today it is a preprint
archive for a broad range of scientific subjects. A recent Nature
article states: “Population biologists turn to pre-publication server to
gain wider readership and rapid review of results" (Callaway 2012).

[PubMedCentral](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc) on the other hand, is a subject repository which, amongst others, hosts
NIH-sponsored manuscripts, while [RePEc (Research Papers in
Economics)](http://repec.org) has
successfully built a service based on the long tradition of publishing
reports in economics. In future, both repository types should get better
linked. If an article is deposited in one type, linkage to the other
should become a standard.

## Green or Gold: Which is the Better Way?

The recommendations of the British Working Group on Expanding Access to
Published Research Findings, the [Finch Report](http://www.researchinfonet.org/publish/finch) preferred Gold to
Green. This triggered a discussion on what the best way to Open
Access is (see, for example, Harnad 2012 or Suber 2012). Obviously, seen
from a scientist’s point of view, both ways have the right to exist.
Looking at the green road means publishing an article wherever one
thinks it is the best for one’s career. At the same time, one makes use
of the opportunity to give access to all relevant readers. Funders’
mandates will not be a problem, the green road is compliant. If
self-archiving is supported by a well made institutional infrastructure,
this way works quickly and easily. Additional costs are generated from
infrastructural needs. In too many institutions there is still poor help
for researchers; too often they are still left alone to self-archive.
Hence, institutions should not only state policies, but actively support
their scientists and strengthen infrastructural backing.

Meanwhile, the golden road is part of an axiomatic change of the
publication landscape. It is a primary publication, which gives
immediate access to an article in the context of its journal, including
linkage to all additional services of a publisher. *“… journals receive
their revenues up front, so they can provide immediate access free of
charge to the peer-reviewed, semantically enriched published article,
with minimal restrictions on use and reuse. For authors, gold means that
decisions on how and where to publish involve balancing cost and quality
of service. That is how most markets operate, and ensures that
competition on quality and price works effectively. It is also
preferable to the current, non-transparent market for scholarly
journals.”*, as the secretary to the Finch committee puts it (Jubb
2012).

Naturally of course, again, the respective traditions of research fields
matter. Björk et al. write *“There is a clear pattern to the internal
distribution between green and gold in the different disciplines
studied. In all the life sciences, gold is the dominating OA access
channel. The picture is reversed in the other disciplines where green
dominated. The lowest overall OA share is in chemistry with 13 % and the
highest in earth sciences with 33 %.”* (Björk et al. 2010).

## New Models

Of course, publishing has its costs and whatever way is followed,
someone has to cover these. In the case of green repositories,
infrastructure needs to be supported by institutions. Article processing
charges for gold publishing are paid by funders or institutions. Most
funders have already reacted and financing at least a part of open
publishing fees has become a standard. Unfortunately, many institutions
currently lack an appropriate workflow for this new challenge.
Traditional journal subscription is generally paid for by libraries. In
institutions it often is not clear to scientists, by whom and how these
open access charges can be managed. Initiatives like the [“Compact for
Open-Access Publishing Equity”](http://oacompact.org/compact/) are paving the way to such workflows
in order to make them a matter of course. The Study of [Open Access
Publishing (SOAP)](http://project-soap.eu/) gave evidence of this challenge:
“Almost 40 % [scientists] said that a lack of funding for publication
fees was a deterrent …” (Vogel 2011). Institutional libraries must face
this challenge and take on a new role. This new role is not too far from
their traditional role: paying for access to information as a service
for scientists. Björn Brembs even sees the future in a “library-based
scholarly communication system for semantically linked literature and
data” instead of the traditional processes dominated by publishers
(Brembs 2012). [SCOAP3 (Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access
Publishing in Particle Physics)](http://scoap3.org) “is currently testing the transition of
a whole community”,
integrating scientific institutions, their libraries, and publishers.

Some publishers feature a hybrid model. They still back the traditional
subscription model, but also offer an opportunity to buy out an
individual article for Open Access. Seen from a scientist’s point of
view this may be interesting, but usually the price level is high and
only a few authors utilize this option. Seen from an institutional point
of view, this is a problematic business model, as article fees and
subscription fees are normally not yet combined. Therefore, institutions
pay twice to a publisher (Björk 2012). Obviously such a hybrid is not a
transition path to Gold.

Since traditional publishers have adopted the Open Access business model
(e.g. Springer in 2010), we have definitely reached a situation in which
Open Access has grown-up.

All stakeholders of the scholarly communication have to check carefully
and adjust their roles in future, as new stakeholders will arise. They
have been closely connected with each other for a long time. Open Access
brought new functions and tasks for each stakeholder within the
classical distribution; not all have already faced up to that challenge.
For example, a lot of publishers are still locked up in thinking in
print terms. In parallel, a common fear is that ACPs will go up and up
when traditional publishers adopt the gold model and will become
unaffordable. Charges differ within a broad range of some hundred Euros
up to over 3000 Euros (Leptin 2012).

We now see a mixture of the roles mentioned. As an example, libraries
can, in certain cases like grey literature, switch to a publisher’s
role. On the other hand, “Nature” experimented with preprint
publication, opening in 2007 [“Nature precedings”](http://precedings.nature.com), closing down the
platform again in 2012. Due to Open Access, new publishing houses were
set up. Some have quickly become respectable and successful, others may
be under suspicion to be predatory [(see Code of Conduct
of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association)](http://oaspa.org/membership/code-of-conduct). Besides, new
players are in the game and it is not yet decided as to where their role
will lie. Publication management systems and scientific social networks
are merging, often relying on Open Access full-texts.

But not only the players have to re-define their role within the
scientific publications process; the format of scientific knowledge is
also changing: *“It no longer consists of only static papers that
document a research insight. In the future, online research literature
will, in an ideal world at least, be a seamless amalgam of papers linked
to relevant data, stand-alone data and software, ‘grey literature’
(policy or application reports outside scientific journals) and tools
for visualization, analysis, sharing, annotation and providing credit. …
And 'publishers' will increasingly include organizations or individuals
who are not established journal publishers, but who host and provide
access and other added value to this online edifice. Some may be
research funders, such as the National Institutes of Health in its
hosting of various databases; some may be research institutions, such as
the European Bioinformatics Institute. Others may be private companies,
including suppliers of tools such as the reference manager Mendeley and
Digital Science, sister company to Nature Publishing Group”* (Nature
2012)**.**

## Books and Grey Literature

For a long time, scientific journals were in the center of Open Access
discussions. Since e-books in scholarly publication are also emerging
very quickly, we will soon see more developments in this field. Of
course, business models are not one to one transferable from journals to
monographs. Nevertheless, it already is clear that there is also a model
for commercial publishers. Often an electronic version of a book is
published Open Access and the publisher gets revenues by selling the
printed version. In some fields, monographs mostly consist of a
compilation of articles. In these cases, their handling could be
comparable to journals. Maybe Springer’s move in August 2012 to
introduce Open Access Books will be copied by other publishers. In the
sciences it is familiar and a long standing tradition that an
institution supports publishing a book by paying high contributions to
publishers. It is just a matter of establishing a new culture to change
the underlying standardized contracts in two points. Firstly, to retain
rights for authors and institutions, secondly, to introduce some kind of
Open Access, [perhaps including an embargo](http://project.oapen.org/index.php/literature-overview).

So called “grey literature” has always played a role in scholarly
communication and was mostly defined by its poor findability and
dissemination. Usually, grey literature was published by scientific
institutions in print with a low circulation rate. But if the content is
trusted, reviewed, and is published Open Access by a reputable
institution in its own electronic publishing infrastructure, grey
literature is up for playing a new and sustainable role in a future
publication landscape. Some even see this as a nucleus for a
rearrangement of roles (see Huffine 2010). Hereby, libraries could be
one of the key players. Important for an Open Access future of grey
literature is a thoroughly-built infrastructure which guarantees
quality, persistence, and citability. New and emerging ways of scholarly
communication can be included in such a structure.

The important role of research data for an Open Science is discussed
elsewhere in this book (see Pampel & Dallmeier-Tiessen in this volume).
Scholarly text publication and data publication cannot be separated in
the future. On the side of Open Access for texts, a close connection to
related data needs to become part of scholarly common sense. Text and
data should be seen as an integral unit which represents the record of
science of a researcher. As Brembs puts it: “Why isn't there a ‘World
Library of Science’ which contains all the scientific literature and
primary data?” (Brembs 2011). Talking about data mining will always have
both parts in mind: text and related research data.

## Impact of Open Access on Publishing

In addition to establishing new business models, Open Access has
featured and accelerated elementary changes in scientific publishing.
The general impact of Open Access upon the development of scholarly
publishing is tremendous.

Peer review is one issue. Already ten years ago, for example, Copernicus
Publications, the largest Open Access publisher in geosciences, combined
open access publishing with a concept of open interactive peer review
(Pöschl 2004).

The rise of [PLOS One](http://plosone.org), an Open Access mega journal promising quick
peer review and publication and accepting articles from all fields, has
changed the scene. PLOS, which is now the largest scientific journal
worldwide with around 14.000 articles per year, has been followed by a
chain of new established journals from other publishers copying the
model. Just to name a few new Open Access journals, and having a look at
the publishers in the background, this following list shows how
important mega journals have become: Springer Plus, BMJ open, Cell
reports, Nature communications, Nature Scientific Reports, and Sage
Open.

Giving away all rights to the publisher when signing an author’s
contract has been one of the strongest points of criticism for years.
Discussions on how authors can retain copyright brought Creative Commons
licenses into the focus. Today, Creative Commons licenses like CC-BY or
CC-BY-SA have become a de facto standard in Open Access publishing (see
as an example Wiley’s recent move to CC-by).[^5] “Re-use” is the
catchword for the perspective which has been opened by introducing such
licenses.

## Benefits

Open Access publications proved to have citation advantages (Gargouri et
al. 2010) resulting from open accessibility of scholarly results
formerly only available in closed access. It guarantees faster
communication and discussion of scientific results. Therefore, it
perfectly assists in fulfilling the most basic scholarly need:
communication. Open Access also promotes transparency and insight for
the public into scientific outcomes (Voronin et al. 2011). The outreach
of scientific work is stimulated.

Tools for a new and comprehensive findability and intensive data mining
to openly accessible texts will certainly be available. This will make
interdisciplinary work easier and productive. Reuse, due to open
licenses, the “possibility to translate, combine, analyze, adapt, and
preserve the scientific material” is easier and will lead to new
outcomes (Carroll 2011).

The statement “In the online era, researchers’ own ‘mandate’ will no
longer just be ‘publish-or-perish’ but ‘self-archive to flourish’”
(Gargouri et al. 2010) can be extended to “researchers’ own
‘mandate’ will no longer just be ‘publish-or-perish’ but give open
access to flourish”.
