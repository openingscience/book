  Citations of relevant works are an integral part of all scholarly papers.
  Collecting, reading, and integrating these references into a manuscript is a
  time-consuming process, and reference managers have facilitated this process
  for more than 25 years. In the past 5 years, we have seen the arrival of a
  large number of new tools with greatly expanded functionality. Most of the
  newer reference managers focus on the collaborative aspects of collecting
  references and writing manuscripts. A number of these newer tools are
  web-based in order to facilitate this collaboration, and some of them are
  also available for mobile devices. Many reference managers now have
  integrated PDF viewers (sometimes with annotation tools) for scholarly
  papers. Reference managers increasingly have to handle other forms of
  scholarly content, from presentation slides to blog posts and web links.
  Open source software and open standards play a growing role in reference
  management. This chapter gives an overview of important trends in reference
  management and describes the most popular tools.

## Introduction

Reference Management is perceived to be tedious and time consuming by
many researchers, especially when it is done manually. In the past,
references used to be written on index cards and stored in boxes.
Reference management software allows for the digitalization of a
personal collection of relevant scholarly publications. The earliest
programs to manage the basic task of storing references and adding them
to manuscripts have been around for over 25 years (including Endnote and
BibTeX/LaTeX-based programs still popular today), but each individual
entry had to be typed in by hand. In the last 15 years we have seen a
number of significant developments that have made reference management
much easier for the researcher:

1.  Retrieval of reference information from online bibliographic
    databases
2.  DOIs and other persistent identifiers for bibliographic information
3.  Automated management of PDF files
4.  Open Access for easier access to full-text content
5.  Web-based reference management for easier collaboration and use
    across multiple devices

In this chapter we describe what reference managers are and provide an
overview of some reference management products. We do not make
recommendations as to which reference manager may be the best as this is
a personal choice and depends upon the workflow of the individual
researcher.

## What is a Reference Manager?

A reference manager supports researchers in performing three basic
research steps: searching, storing, and writing [@fenner_2010a]. It helps
researchers find relevant literature, allows them to store papers and
their bibliographic metadata in a personal database for later retrieval,
and allows researchers to insert citations and references in a chosen
citation style when writing a text. To support those steps, a reference
manager should have the following functionalities as identified by
Gilmour and Cobus-Kuo [-@gilmour_2011]:

1.  Import citations from bibliographic databases and websites
2.  Gather metadata from PDF files
3.  Allow organization of citations within the reference manager
    database
4.  Allow annotation of citations
5.  Allow sharing of the reference manager database or portions thereof
    with colleagues
6.  Allow data interchange with other reference manager products through
    standard metadata formats (e.g. RIS, BibTeX)
7.  Produce formatted citations in a variety of styles
8.  Work with word processing software to facilitate in-text citation

A reference manager is a software package that allows scientific authors
to collect, organize, and use bibliographic references or citations. The
terms citation manager or bibliographic management software are used
interchangeably. The software package usually consists of a database
that stores references and citations. Once a citation is inserted into
the database, it can be reused to create bibliographies which are
typically found at the end of a scientific text.

Almost all reference managers allow direct importing from bibliographic
databases through direct access from the reference manager and/or
bookmarklets that import content from the web browser. Alternatively,
references can be imported from other reference managers or from files
in the BibTeX standard format with the help of import tools.

The reference database can then be searched, indexed, and labeled. Most
reference managers offer tools for organizing the references into
folders and subfolders. Some reference managers allow the inclusion of
full-text papers in PDF format. References can be shared via the
internet and organized into workgroups so that all members can use the
same reference database.

Reference managers offer tools for exporting citations and references
into word processing programs by selecting relevant items from the
database. The citation style can be selected from a corresponding
database which contains styles that aim to cover the requirements of a
large number of scholarly publishers. Some reference managers allow for
styles to be edited and saved.

There is a wide variety of reference management software, and the
strengths and weaknesses of reference management software are perceived
differently depending on the workflows of individual scientists. The
deciding factor for a particular reference manager is often its
popularity within a particular community, as collaboratively writing a
manuscript is facilitated if all authors use the same reference manager
(see case 24, Bartling: How this book was created using collaborative
authoring and cloud tools). Reference managers have been commercially
available for a long time, but free solutions offer comparable
functionalities and are increasingly gaining importance.

Some reference managers allow the sharing, collaborative editing, and
synchronization of reference databases across a private workgroup and/or
publicly via the internet. The public sharing of references is the focus
of online-only social bookmarking tools such as CiteULike and Bibsonomy,
but is also available with other reference managers. This functionality
makes it possible to share open access papers online (see chapter 09,
Sitek et al: Open Access: A State of the Art) and to generate usage
statistics as a novel means of measuring scientific impact (see chapter
12, Fenner et al: Altmetrics and Other Novel Measures for Scientific
Impact).

## Getting References into the Reference Manager

All reference managers provide the functionality to manually enter
bibliographic data. However, it is more convenient if the references are
automatically extracted from an online bibliographic database such as
Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, or Google Scholar. Most reference
managers can also import references directly from a webpage, usually
using information embedded via CoinS. All reference managers can
import/export references in the BibTeX and/or RIS format; this is a
convenient way to share reference lists with colleagues.

### Bibliographic Databases

Some of the largest bibliographic databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and
others) are only available via a subscription. In the last 10 years we
have seen the emergence of an increasing number of openly available
bibliographic databases. This trend started with PubMed in the late
1990s, includes Google Scholar, and, more recently, Microsoft Academic
Search and the CrossRef Metadata Search, and now also includes
bibliographic databases built by reference managers themselves (e.g.
Mendeley or CiteULike). The availability of these databases increases
the options for researchers to automatically import citation
information, either via direct integration into the reference manager,
or via bookmarklet that captures the bibliographic content on the web
page.

### COinS: Hassle Free Import of Bibliographic Data

COinS (ContextObjects in Spans) is a method that includes relevant
bibliographic metadata of a scientific publication into the HTML code of
a web page. If appropriate plugins are installed in a standard web
browser, the bibliographic information of a reference can be easily
retrieved by a reference manager, thus omitting tedious copy and paste
processes. For example, if a reference is found in PubMed, a little
symbol appears in the browser address line if the Zotero plugin is
installed. At the click of a button, all important bibliographic
information will be transferred into the Zotero database. Many
scientific databases, scientific social networks, and journals support
COinS.

![**Figure 1**. Showing COinS in action. At the click of a button, a
reference is included into the reference manager software (Zotero) from
information that is contained in the COinS information in the displayed
web page: No need to manually copy references.](/images/reference_management_coins.jpg)

### Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and other Unique Identifiers

Most journal articles can now be uniquely identified by a digital object
identifier (DOI). DOIs for journal articles are issued by CrossRef, a
non-profit organization that has most scholarly publishers as its
members. DOIs can also be used for other content, e.g. conference
proceedings or book chapters. DataCite is another non-profit
organization that can issue DOIs, focusing on DOIs for datasets. There
are also other unique identifiers for scholarly content, e.g. the PubMed
ID, PubMed Central ID, or the ArXiV ID. These identifiers make it much
easier to handle bibliographic information: reference managers can
extract the DOI from imported PDFs, obtain more citation information
using the DOI, store the DOI internally to help find duplicate records,
etc. Authors only need to worry about the DOI (or other unique
identifier), all the other information they need (authors, title,
journal, link to the full-text) can be obtained from it.

### Standardized Bibliographic Data Formats: BibTeX and RIS

BibTeX and RIS are the two most established file formats for storing
bibliographic data, and one or both of these formats are supported by
all reference managers. Exporting data in a standardized format is
important because it allows users to backup their reference lists
independently of the reference management software, to switch from one
reference manager to another, or to use multiple reference managers in
parallel.

* **BibTeX** has existed since the mid â80s and was designed to be
  used in combination with the typesetting system LaTeX. The format is
  now widely supported by reference managers that work with Microsoft
  Word and other authoring tools, and by online bibliographic
  databases such as Google Scholar.
* **RIS** (Research Information Systems) is standardized tag format
  originally invented by Research Information Systems (now part of
  Thomson Reuters). The format is widely supported and has been
  adapted over time, e.g. to include a field for digital object
  identifiers (DOIs).
* **Endnote XML and Citeproc JSON** are newer formats which are not
  yet as widely supported. BibTeX and RIS are plain text formats. XML
  and, more recently, JSON have evolved into the standard data
  exchange formats of the Web, and are easier to process
  automatically. They may therefore over time become the predominant
  formats for exchanging bibliographic information.

## Citation styles and CSL (Citation Style Language)

Citations can be formatted in many different ways: By what information
to include (authors, title, journal, year, issue, pages), how to order
and format this information, and how to reference these citations in the
main text (e.g. by number or author/year). These so-called citation
styles are important for printed documents, but are not really relevant
for digital content (where citations are exchanged in BibTeX and other
data formats). Unfortunately, most manuscript submission systems do not
accept references in digital format, and authors are forced to format
their references in the style requested by the publisher and include
them as plain text at the end of the manuscript (and, in turn,
publishers then spend time and money to get these references back into a
bibliographic data format).

What publishers are really interested in are unique identifiers, such as
the DOI, for all references. This allows them to double-check the
reference information against bibliographic databases (using tools such
as eXtyles), and to format the citations into their preferred style.
Citation information in free-text format can contain errors, and these
errors are propagated if citations are entered manually (see [@specht_2010]).

Citation styles are needed not only to correctly identify all references
(for which bibliographic formats and digital identifiers are better
suited), but also to help the researcher while reading the text.
Citations are an important part of all scholarly documents, and citation
styles should facilitate that process. Even though a number of common
styles exist (e.g. APA, MLA, Chicago, Vancouver), there is no standard
style for citations in scholarly documents, and with the differences in
citation practices between disciplines, it is not likely to ever happen.
Some disciplines use simple reference lists at the end of the document,
whereas other disciplines use footnotes at the bottom of pages and/or
make heavy use of annotations.

Until it becomes standard practice to submit references in a
bibliographic file format together with manuscripts (some publishers do
this already), authors must resultingly deal with a large number of
citation styles. This also often means changing the citation style when
a paper has to be resubmitted to another journal. This is a time
consuming endeavor, thus automating the process of adjusting to the
various citation styles is an important feature of all reference
managers.

Most reference managers support a large number of citation styles:
[EndNote](http://endnote.com/downloads/styles) supports
over 5,000 bibliographic styles, and [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/citationstyles/),
[Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/support/styles),
and Papers all support [more than 6,000 citation styles](http://blog.mendeley.com/academic-features/mendeley-contributes-2000-citation-styles-to-the-open-citation-style-repository-at-citationstyles-org/).
Some reference managers include a style editor, in case
a particular style is not yet supported. Citation styles used to be in
proprietary format and owned by the publisher of the reference manager,
but the [Citation Style Language](http://citationstyles.org/) (CSL)
has evolved as an open XML-based language to describe the formatting of
citations and bibliographies. Originally created by Bruce D'Arcus and further
developed in collaboration with Zotero developer Simon Kornblith, CSL is now
also used by Mendeley, Papers, and many other tools and services. In
2012, a [web-based editor](http://editor.citationstyles.org/about/) to
create and edit CSL styles was launched, facilitating the creation of
additional styles.

## Managing full-text Content

Reference management has traditionally been about managing information
about scholarly content (authors, title, journal, and other metadata).
With the switch to digital publication and the availability of content
in PDF, as well as other formats, reference management increasingly
dealt with managing this digital content: linking references to the
full-text document on the computer, performing full-text search, making
annotations in the PDF, managing the PDF files on the hard drive, etc..
Papers was the first reference manager to focus on this aspect, but most
reference managers now have functionality to manage PDF files.

Most scholarly journal articles are currently distributed via
subscription journals. This makes it important to store a copy on the
local hard drive for easier access, but it can also create problems when
these PDF files are shared with collaborators (which most publishers do
not allow, even within the same institution). Reference management
software therefore has to make decisions as to what is technically
possible and convenient for researchers vs. what is possible under
copyright law (see chapter 15, Stodden: Intellectual Property and
Computational Science).

Content published as open access does not have these limitations. This
not only makes it much easier to share relevant full-text articles with
collaborators, but it also means that we often do not need to store a
copy of the full-text on the local hard drive, as the content is readily
available.

## Reference Management Tools

From the large number of available reference managers, we have chosen
seven popular products that are described in more detail below. We have
included a table that gives an overview of their basic features. A
feature list is not the only criterion in picking a reference manager
though; ease of use, stability, price, and available support in case of
questions are equally important factors.

### EndNote

EndNote is a commercial reference management software package produced
by Thomson Reuters. Endnote is one of the most popular reference
managers and has been around for more than 20 years. It allows the
collection of references from online resources and PDFs. References from
bibliographic databases can be imported into EndNote libraries.
full-text can be imported too. EndNote provides plugins for Microsoft
Word and OpenOffice. References can be exported to BibTeX. While EndNote
does not include any collaborative features, EndNote Web provides the
functionality for collaboration with other users. Users can give group
members read/write access to their references and import references from
other peopleâs libraries. Endnote also integrates with other
bibliographic tools produced by Thomson Reuters, including Web of
Science and ResearcherID.

### Mendeley

Mendeley is a reference manager developed by a London-based startup. Its
strength lies in its networking and collaborative features, and also in
providing facilities for easily managing PDF files. It offers both a
desktop and a web version with synchronized bibliographic information,
allowing access from several computers and collaboration with other
users. PDF files can be imported into Mendeley desktop and metadata such
as authors, title, and journal are automatically extracted. It is
possible to do a full-text search, highlight text in PDFs, and add
sticky notes.

The web version recommends papers to users based on their profiles and
the content in their libraries. Users can create both private and public
groups and share papers and annotations. Mendeley is free to use, but
costs a monthly fee if the number of documents in Mendeley web or the
number of private groups exceeds a limit.

### Zotero

Zotero is a popular open source reference manager, originally developed
as a plugin for the Firefox browser. The newer Zotero Standalone offers
the same functionality but runs as a separate program and works with
Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. Zotero also includes a hosted version in
order to synchronize references across devices and share them in private
or public groups.

Zotero allows users to collect and to organize a variety of web sources
such as citations, full-texts, web pages, images and audio files
directly in the browser. Citations from Zotero can be integrated into
Microsoft Word and OpenOffice.

### RefWorks

RefWorks is a commercial web-based reference manager by ProQuest. The
Write N Cite utility enables the integration of references into
Microsoft Word where in-text citations and reference lists can be
formatted into various styles. RefWorks makes it easy to collaborate
with others as all references are stored in the web-based version. The
Write N Cite utility can also work offline, but RefWorks is not the
right tool for researchers with intermittent or poor internet
connectivity.

### Papers

Papers is a commercial reference management software, now part of
Springer Science+Business media. Initially Papers was only available for
Mac, but now there are also versions for iPad and PC. Its main strength
is its excellent handling of PDF documents (including metadata
extraction) and its polished user interface, whereas the collaborative
features are less developed than in some of the other products. Papers
uses the Citation Style Language and provides a word processor plugin.

### JabRef

JabRef is an open source bibliography reference manager popular with
LaTeX users. It runs on Java and is thus compatible with Windows, Linux,
and Mac. The native file format is BibTeX which is the standard LaTeX
bibliography format. The strength of JabRef is that references can be
formatted directly in LaTeX, thus providing access and control over a
wide range of citation styles. JabRef provides direct search and
downloads from PubMed and IEEEXplore. There are plugins for word
processing programs and also other Java based plugins, which expand the
general functionality.

### CiteULike

CiteULike is a free online reference manager and social bookmarking
tool. References are primarily entered via a bookmarklet that captures
bibliographic content in web pages. New entries are public by default
and are added to the common library, but entries can be also made
private. Users can assign tags to entries which make it easier to
organize and search through content. References can be exported in
BibTeX and RIS formats. The social networking features are the strength
of CiteULike. Users can create profiles, connect with other researchers,
and create and join groups where they can collaborate on library
content.

### Other Reference Management Products

Many other reference managers are available, including Citavi which is
popular in some disciplines and also helps with knowledge management,
and ReadCube which has a very nice user interface and a good PDF viewer.
An extensive list and comparison of available reference management
software [can be found on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software).

## Outlook

Reference management has become easier, cheaper, and more social in the
past few years, and this trend will continue. We will see the
integration of unique author identifiers (ORCID, etc.) into
bibliographic databases and reference management tools (see case 21,
Fenner & Haak: Unique Identifiers for Researchers), and this will
facilitate the discovery of relevant literature and the automatic
updating of publication lists. We will increasingly see citations of
datasets and other non-text content (see chapter 14, Pampel &
Dallmeier-Tiessen: Open Research Data - From Vision to Practice).
Digital identifiers for content and support for the open Citation Style
Language will also increase, as will the availability of open
bibliographic information. Three areas still need improvement: Firstly,
the automatic importing of the references of a particular publication,
and the integration of reference managers into authoring tools.
Secondly,the word processor plugins for reference managers still do not
work together, and some of the newer online authoring tools (Google
Docs, etc.) need to be better integrated with reference managers.
Finally, instead of having references in plain text, which makes it
difficult to get to the full-text and reformat it into a different
citation style, publishers, institutions, and funders should start to
ask for reference lists in standard bibliographic formats using digital
identifiers.
