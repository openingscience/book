abstract: |
 Academic publishing, as a practice and as a business, is undergoing the most
 significant changes in its 350-year history. Electronic journals and books,
 both open access and behind digital pay walls, are increasingly replacing
 printed publications. In addition to formal channels of scholarly
 communication, a wide array of semi-formal and informal channels such as
 email, mailing lists, blogs, microblogs, and social networking sites (SNS) are
 widely used by scientists to discuss their research (Borgman 2007, p. 47;
 Nentwich & König 2012, p. 50). Scholarly blogs and services such as Twitter
 and Facebook are increasingly attracting attention as new channels of science
 communication (see Bonetta 2007; Kjellberg 2010; Herwig et al. 2009).
 Radically different conceptualizations of scholarly (micro)blogging exist,
 with some users regarding them as a forum to educate the public, while others
 see them as a possible replacement for traditional publishing. This chapter
 will provide examples of blogs and microblogs as tools for scientific
 communication for different stakeholders, as well as discussing their
 implications for digital scholarship.

## Framing the Issue: New Forms of Scholarly Communication and Science 2.0

There is a broad consensus that modern science is undergoing profound
structural changes afforded by the rise of digital technology, and that
this change is occuring on multiple levels of the scientific work
process at once (Nielsen 2012, Nentwich & König 2012). The abundance of
massive storage capacities, high volumes of processing power, and
ubiquitous network access enables new forms of research which are
contingent on large quantities of digital data and its efficient
computational analysis (Weinberger 2011). This development is
underscored by the rise of *data science*, that is, science that is
driven by the analysis of large quantities of data from a wide range of
sources such as sensors, scanners, MRI, telescopes, but also
human-generated data from social media and digital libraries, and
interrogated through statistical procedures, machine learning
algorithms, and other computational measures, allowing researchers to
discover previously unrecognized patterns. Such approaches are
innovative in the sense that they surpass the capabilities of
traditional research in making observations of changes in very complex
systems as they unfold, and in that they potentially allow predictions
regarding the future behavior of such systems (Golder & Macy 2012).
Whereas research has in the past been based upon comparably scarce
evidence, the promise of data science is that it will be both scalable
and reproducible on a previously unimaginable level, providing novel
insights into a wide array of areas, from climatology to social science
(Lazer et al. 2009).

Beyond innovation of research methods, other aspects of how science is
undertaken are also changing visibly, both as a result of technological
shifts and because of economic and cultural changes in how research is
financed and organized (cf. several contributions in this volume). From
teaching and funding to publishing and peer review, it seems that a
variety of aspects of how scientists work are changing, and that
communication is at the forefront of this change, a change brought about
primarily by the proliferation of technologies which are themselves the
result of publicly funded scientific research. These technologies not
only make it easier, cheaper, and quicker for scientists to exchange
information with peers around the globe, they also have the potential to
blur the line between internal communication among researchers and
communication with the wider public. New formats must be adopted for
scholarly use to fit the needs of academics while established genres
evolve as a result of new technologies for the production and
dissemination of scholarly publications (Cope & Kalantzis 2009).

Scientists have, of course, always been avid communicators. From
Darwin’s notebooks to the Large Hadron Collider, getting complex
scientific issues across both to colleagues and laypersons has been at
the top of the agenda for researchers for as long as modern science has
existed. Successful communication is integral to scholarship because it
allows scientific knowledge to proliferate, enable practical
applications, and become entrenched societal knowledge, but also because
frequently the outcomes of scientific research have far-reaching
societal implications and are highly controversial (e.g., climate
research, nuclear energy, genetics). Scientists must be able to explain
what they do to a broader public to garner political support and funding
for endeavors whose outcomes are unclear at best and dangerous at worst,
a difficulty which is magnified by the complexity of scientific issues.
They do so in an increasingly challenging environment, engaging with a
public that has access to a wide range of sources of (by scientific
standards) often dubious quality, many of them online (Puschmann & Mahrt
2012; König 2011). This public is increasingly critical and unimpressed
by scientific authority and simple promises of scientific progress as an
enabler of economic growth and societal welfare, and must be both won
over and brought on board, rather than talked down to. Civil society
expects to be engaged in a dialog with science, rather than being
lectured. The affordances of social media (blogs, wikis, social
networking sites) should be regarded as supporting a general long-term
shift towards a more egalitarian relationship between experts and the
lay public, rather than driving it.

![**Figure 2**. CERN’s Twitter page.](/images/microblogging_cern.png)

Intra-scientific discourse is changing as well, as a result of the move
from paper to digital, which seems almost completed in much of the hard
sciences. The majority of formal publishing in the STM disciplines takes
place in academic journals and conference proceedings, with pre-prints,
post-prints, reports, technical manuals, posters, and other formats also
playing an important role (Borgman 2007). Increasingly, traditional
academic genres (journal articles, conference papers, scholarly
monographs) are published online, rather than in print, and disseminated
through a variety of channels (email, blogs, online book reviews, social
media). Preprint archives such as
*[arXiv](http://www.arXiv.org)* and *[Social
Science Research Network](http://www.ssrn.com)
(SSRN)* have proliferated
in a variety of disciplines and continue to grow in popularity. Beyond
open access, there is an increased push for adding features that make
use of the affordances of digital publishing, such as interactive charts
and figures, and towards providing raw data along with papers to
encourage follow-up research, for example on sites such as
*[Figshare](http://www.figshare.com)*.

## Science Blogging as a New Form of Engaging with Science

While still an emergent phenomenon, new and genuinely digital forms of
scholarly communication play an increasingly significant role in
discussions about the future of academic discourse, especially as the
existing system of knowledge dissemination is increasingly characterized
as threatened or even dysfunctional (cf. Cope & Kalantzis 2009; Stein &
Puschmann 2010). The phenomenon of science blogging has attracted
significant attention and discussion in papers (e.g., Batts et al. 2008;
Tola 2008; Shema et al. 2012) and at conferences (e.g., ScienceOnline
‘09, Science Blogging 2008: London). Sites such as *Nature Network*,
*ScienceBlogs.com*, and *Hypotheses.org* act as hosting platforms of
such specialized academic content, allowing researchers to present and
discuss their work before a global audience, some with commercial
publishers backing them, others funded publicly. Increasingly,
universities and research institutes offer blog hubs which either
aggregate externally-hosted content contributed by students and faculty
members or allow direct publishing through the institutional website.
Many academic researchers also rely on commercial hosting platforms such
as *Wordpress.com* and *Blogger.com* to exchange information with peers
and to document their projects.

A non-scholarly genre that has been adopted for scholarly communication,
blogs are just one tool in a wider array of new formats. New platforms
for publishing such as *Open Journal Systems* (OJS) and *Annotum* seek
to make the processing and presentation of scholarly texts better
adjusted to their digital environment. Monographs are also redefined in
new approaches from initiatives such as *PressForward* or *OpenEdition*,
which seek to modify both the dissemination of academic publications and
the economics behind its distribution (costly production techniques,
long delays between authoring and publication). Beyond making the
results of scholarly research available online, efforts are being made
to make scholarly formats themselves more innovative and better adjusted
to the Internet (cf. Jankowski et al. 2012). The need to facilitate new
means of knowledge production, presentation, and dissemination is widely
felt, not only inside science itself, but also among policymakers. This
need is fuelled both by the exponential growth of scholarly publishing
(Jinha 2010) and the costs associated with the current model of
subscription-based access. Different models have been proposed among the
different varieties of open access (i.e. the ‘gold road’ model of
immediate open access and the ‘green road’ model of delayed open access
after an embargo period). Alternate funding schemes include author fees
and institutional consortia, as well as direct public funding, for
example via libraries (Houghton 2010).

Beyond the use outlined above—researchers using blogs to communicate
their work, primarily to peers, a wide variety of other approaches to
science (or, more broadly, scholarly) blogging exist, depending on
communicators, target audience, and function. For example, it is widely
assumed that because they are public, science blogs should be used to
present the results of scientific research to a wider audience. Often
blogging is seen as a new component of science journalism which is
consequently something not just done by scientists, but also by
journalists, or by enthusiasts with knowledge in a given area of science
(Bonetta 2007). Frequently when the term *science blogging* (or
*scholarly blogging*) is used, it is only implicitly clear which kind of
blogging is meant, the variety that complements scholarly communication
in journal articles and scholarly monographs, or the one that
complements science journalism. It seems likely that different variants
will continue to exist as a result of the freedom to innovate and create
new genres online. In the following I will briefly discuss two different
science blogs as examples of these different approaches in an attempt to
underscore how blogging complements the needs of scientists and science
communicators (journalists, activists, hobbyists) alike. While there is
some overlap, it is important to be aware of the different needs of
these actors.

When approaching science blogs and an emergent communicative practice,
it is helpful to first outline the roles they play for different
stakeholders in the ecosystem of scholarly communication. Tables 1 and 2
give an overview of the various roles played by different actors, and of
some of the motives of scientists who blog for different reasons,
respectively.

## Case 1: Rosie Redfield (RRResearch)

*RRResearch* is the blog of Rosemarie (‘Rosie’) Redfield, a
microbiologist at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, and
head of the Redfield Lab at UBC’s Department of Zoology. The blog was
initially published on the commercial service *Blogspot*, but has since
then moved to the independent blog network *[Field of
Science](http://www.fieldofscience.com)* which
uses the *[Google Blogger](http://www.blogger.com)* as its
technical backbone but is maintained so as to feature high quality
scientific content contributed by experts from different fields.

Since August 2006, Redfield has posted over 900 entries on the blog,
discussing various issues of her research. Her
[initial post](http://rrresearch.fieldofscience.com/2006_08_01_archive.html)
gives a good idea about the direction of the blog:

>This is my first post to this new blog.
>
>The purpose of keeping the blog is to give me a semi-public place to
>describe the ongoing process of doing and thinking about my lab’s
>research. I hope I’ll use it to describe/explain (mainly to myself)
>the scientific issues I'm thinking about:
>
>* what experiments we’ve done
>* what the results were if they worked (or possible explanations for
>  why they didn’t work)
>* what I think the results mean for the questions we’re trying to
>  answer
>* what experiments I think we might do or should do when time and
>  resources permit.
>
>The purpose of this post, however, is mainly to see what happens when
>I click on ‘Publish Post’.

While many posts are devoted to documenting and describing her
research—often, as emphasized in the post above, seemingly with herself
in mind as reader, quite a few touch related issues relevant to a less
specialized audience. For example, several early posts cover Bayesian
statistics and discuss its use in genetics research. Many posts are
related to meta-issues in scientific work, i.e. grant proposals, journal
submissions, and other aspects that are part of work processes at a
genetics laboratory.

While Redfield’s blog was known to an expert audience before, she
attained major success as a result of the post *“Arsenic-associated
bacteria (NASA’s claims)”* (Redfield 2010) that strongly critiqued the
paper “*A Bacterium That Can Grow by Using Arsenic Instead of
Phosphorus”* (Wolfe-Simon et al. 2010) which had been previously
published in the journal *Science*. In the blog post, Redfield
initially reports the findings of the paper and then proceeds with a
detailed criticism of the methodology used by the authors of the study.
As in other entries, she mixes a somewhat informal style with the
vocabulary of a scientific paper. She also includes numerous figures,
illustrations, and references, making the post comparable to a review in
a scientific journal.

![**Figure 4**. The first post published on RRResearch in August 2006.](/images/microblogging_rrresearch.png)

The post received over 250 comments and a polished version was later
published by *Science*, though the original article was not retracted.
Redfield’s success in using her blog to voice her criticism, rather than
using the traditional channels, was seen by many as a turning point in
the dynamics of science communication—a journal widely recognized for
its rigour saw itself forced to react to criticism posted in a blog.

*RRResearch* is the blog of a scientist, who accordingly uses it as part
of a wider communicative agenda. While most writing done by academics is
geared towards peers and written to withstand their scrutiny and
criticism, writing a blog “for oneself” amounts to a space where freer,
less regimented expression is possible. Redfield is, of course, aware
that her blog is widely read, but its status as something other than a
formally recognized publication is an asset, because it allows her to
address issues that wouldn’t generally fit into a formal publications.
Yet *RRResearch* is also not a typical science blog in the sense that
most journalists or science educators would interpret the
term—understanding much of what is published in it presupposes in-depth
knowledge of biochemistry and Redfield makes no attempt to dumb down her
writing to make it more palatable to a lay audience.

## Case 2: Bora Zivkovic (A Blog Around the Clock)

Bora Zivkovic is a well-known blogger and science educator with a
background in veterinary medicine and biology. He teaches introductory
biology at North Caroline Wesleyan College, organizes *ScienceOnline*
conference series, and has been a visiting scholar at New York
University’s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute.

Zivkovic started his site *A Blog Around the Clock* (ABATC) in 2006,
after moving from *Blogger.com* to *ScienceBlogs*. In 2011, the blog was
moved again, this time to *Scientific American*, where Zivkovic became
the first Blog Editor. After he took up blogging in 2002, Zivkovic
gradually gained wide recognition as a science blogger, not least
because of the impressive volume of his activity. In the time before
moving from *Blogger* to *ScienceBlogs* alone, he produced a total of
2420 posts about a variety of topics. While frequently these are short
texts pointing to a news item, video, or other piece of information,
many are detailed essays about (broadly) science and politics, science
and the general public, etc. His style is not only less formal than that
of Rosie Redfield, but he also uses considerably less scientific
terminology. The considerable volume of content that flows through
*ABATC* make it a virtual popular science magazine, covering a breadth
of issues and formats (including blog carnivals and other outreach
mechanisms that aim to strengthen connections with other blogs).
Zivkovic both relays information from other sources, commenting on it
and explaining it to readers, and provides longer commentaries, for
example on issues of science policy. He assumes that his readers are
interested in science, but does not generally presume in-depth knowledge
of scientific topics. This approach is in line with Zivkovic’s own
background: while he is a trained scientist and writes from a first-hand
perspective, his agenda is not that of someone paid for full-time
research.

While *RRResearch* presents both the results of research (rarely) and
frames scientific issues for a scientific audience, *ABATC* translates
scientific topics for a more general, non-specialist audience. The
issues are much broader there than they are in *RRResearch*, where they
align much more strongly with the blogger’s own research interests. The
latter blog is a window into the mind and daily work of the researcher,
not a friendly conversation with a lay audience. This is not to say that
*RRResearch* doesn’t engage—its success illustrates how well it achieves
this goal—but whom it targets as its readership and what function it
wants to realize remains at least partially unclear. Redfield uses her
blog to frame issues for herself and her peers, while Zivkovic blogs for
a readership with their needs squarely in mind. Much of the research
that he relays is not his own, while much of what is discussed in
*RRResearch* is Redfield’s own work, or closely related to it. Whereas
Redfield regards her blog as an instrument for communicating what she is
currently working on or issues she is more generally interested in,
Zivkovic provides a service and measures its success, at least in part,
by its popularity and the amount of feedback he receives, a form of
impact that may well be less relevant to a blogger like Redfield, who
might be primarily concerned with her blog’s reception among her
students and peers.

## The Uses of Microblogs for Science: Two Scenarios

Compared to blogging, which has a history that reaches back to the
beginning of the Web itself, microblogs are still a relatively new form
of communication. Microblogs share with “normal” blogs the sequential
organization of information in dated entries, but they are usually
constrained in length to facilitate scanning a large number of posts
rapidly. Another point of distinction is that microblogs are typically
centralized services rather than decentralized software packages that
can be run from one’s own webserver. *Twitter* is by far the most
popular service, though competitors exist, both related specifically to
science and for general use[^1]. As with blogs, the potential uses of
microblogs for scholarly communication are highly varied, ranging from
virtual journal clubs (Reich 2011) and debates about current,
science-related events, to self-help for graduate students (for example,
under the \#phdchat hashtag). Microblogs are also a way for scientists
to stay up to date about what their colleagues are working on, while at
the same time providing a window into current scientific research for
science journalists and facilitating interaction between scientists and
the general public (Puschmann & Mahrt 2012). The lack of a dividing line
between scientists and non-scientists, as well as the great variety of
topics that even scientists tweet about mean that *Twitter* is not
comparable to the orderly world of science publishing, where every piece
of information is assumed to be relevant. Instead, a typical user’s
timeline is likely to be populated both by scholarly content and
personal remarks, more or less side by side. As the size of the network
and the thematic broadness of *Twitter* is what makes it interesting to
most users, it seems unlikely that this “problem” will ever be remedied
at its core, but the ability to filter information from *Twitter* and
similar services is likely to resolve the issue [^2]. Tweets and other social
media information can congregate around a journal article or piece of
data—an approach that may also be beneficial for the development of
dedicated science services. Such services could eventually become a
reality as the strengths of services like *Twitter* are at once also a
weakness: while timely, tweets are not accessible in the long term, and
increased brevity also means less nuanced information in each tweet.
Wide proliferation and ease of use may eventually be offset by problems
regarding access to and long-term preservation of data. As with
*[FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com)*, which was
enthusiastically embraced by a small community of scientists, it is
completely unclear how *Twitter* will evolve and the concerns of
academics are likely to matter very little in respect to this. It is
conceivable that policymakers will eventually put into place an
infrastructure that will support the kind of communication taking place
on *Twitter*, at least between scientists, rather than leaving vital
issues to private companies that do not have scientific issues at the
center of their attention. While it is impossible to tell how many
scientists are already using *Twitter* and similar services and in what
ways, it is safe to say that the significance of microblogging is
growing, while its role for science communication continues to evolve
(cf. Puschmann & Mahrt 2012). In the following, two common scenarios for
the use of microblogs will be described in more detail: tweeting at
scientific conferences and using *Twitter* to cite papers in open access
journals and repositories.

## Case 1: Twitter at Conferences

Conferences are all about communication. When used in the context of
scientific conferences, *Twitter* acts as a backchannel, in other words,
it complements what happens at the conference itself, allowing
attendees, and quite frequently also people who are unable to attend, to
comment, ask questions, and participate in the discussion taking place.
It is important to point out that this complements the face to face
activity, rather than replacing it. It is a major advantage that a talk
can take place uninterrupted while a lively discussion takes place about
it on *Twitter*. A drawback of this approach is that the presenter
cannot participate in the debate while it is underway and while being
the the subject of discussion, sometimes also criticism. The use of a
*Twitter* wall, i.e. a projection of hashtagged tweets usually shown
next to or behind the presenter, can aggravate this problem. In November
2009, social media researcher Danah Boyd held a talk at the media
industry event *WebExpo New York* that was accompanied by a *Twitter*
wall showing tweets posted under the conference hashtag. As Boyd
delivered her presentation, which was beset by technical difficulties,
she was the subject of intense polemical remarks from spectators via
*Twitter*; all the while, she herself could not see the projection of
the offensive tweets as she spoke. Though this kind of incident is rare,
it underlines the double-sidedness of a technology that is open and easy
to use, but therefore also easy to abuse under certain circumstances.
*Twitter* walls, apart from being a distraction, seem to add fairly
little communicatively to the overall conference, although their precise
placement (e.g. in the lobby, rather the main conference hall) seems a
key issue to be aware of.

![**Figure 6**. Network visualization of retweets among users at the World
Wide Web 2010 Conference (\#www2010), held in April 2010 in Raleigh,
North Carolina.](/images/microblogging_visualisation.png)

Examining the usage of *Twitter* during conferences, it is notable how
specific the usage of scientists is compared to users of different
backgrounds, and that at the same time microblogging is always more
informal communication than traditional publishing, not just because of
its brevity. Rather than chatting idly, researchers share information
via *Twitter—*they point to papers and posters, to datasets online, and
to websites related to their research (Weller & Puschmann 2011). Passing
on (retweeting) this information is extremely popular, more so than just
exchanging pleasantries or gossip. At the same time, academics also link
to the same resources that other users do, such as online picture
services such as *Instagram* or *Twitpic* or video platforms like
*YouTube* and *Vimeo* (Thelwall et al. 2012), and they link to a variety
of popular science content, i.e. science articles from newspapers
(Weller, Dröge, & Puschmann 2011). The continuum between personal and
professional is frequently blurred on microblogging platforms.
Conferences act as a sort of content filter—because the event that a
conference hashtag is associated with is all about a professional
activity, what is tweeted under the hashtag is usually related fairly
closely to the topic of the event, though meta-topics such as the
conference program or pointers to the venue of conference venue are also
popular.

## Case 2: Twitter for Citations

Beyond conferences, *Twitter* also plays an increasingly important role
for day-to-day communication among scientists. Academics are often
interested in a variety of topics outside of their specific field of
research and accordingly tweet about many things which are the not
subject of their work or comment in ways that differ from traditional
scholarly communication. This highlights an issue of informal digital
communication online: it is extremely hard to determine what constitutes
a scientifically “valuable” contribution and what does not. While some
tweets are related to scholarly issues and others are obviously personal
in nature, many occupy a meso-level between what is traditionally
considered scholarly content and what usually is not. Counting every
tweet mentioning a scholarly source as scientifically valuable is
obviously too simplistic, as is discarding every personal remark as
irrelevant.

This is a particularly salient issue because an increasing number of
studies examine the relevance of social media for scientometrics, in
other words, the role that social media can play in measuring and
predicting the impact of scientific research (e.g., Weller & Puschmann
2011, Eysenbach 2011). By conservative estimates, popular sites such as
*arXiv* received around 5,000 links per month[^3] and this is bound to
increase in the future. If the popular reception of scholarly literature
among scientists and non-scientists alike via *Twitter* can be
considered a form of impact (and many agree that it can), this means
that citations on *Twitter* and via other channels may be introduced as
a valid impact measure into the scientometric toolkit in the future (cf.
the suggestions of Priem, Piwowar & Hemminger 2012 in this direction).

## Who Uses Blogs and Microblogs for Scholarly Communication, And Why?

In the environment of change outlined above, it is only logical to ask
why new forms of communication online—blogs, *Twitter*, social
networks—haven’t proliferated to a greater extent. If the examples of
innovative usage of blogs and *Twitter* to communicate among scientists
and more broadly about science give a reason to be optimistic, actual
usage of such tools among scientists—defined here as the broad base of
academics employed for research and teaching at universities and
research institutes—should caution enthusiasts. International studies on
the acceptance rate of social media among scientists vary considerably
in their results, but many suggest widespread skepticism (cf. Procter et
al. 2010; Bader, Fritz, & Gloning 2012)[^4]. While pointing to examples
where new formats have succeeded is useful, it is also worth noting that
scientists are conservative when it comes to embracing new technologies,
both for internal communication and in relation to new means of engaging
with the general public. This may be changing, but it seems important to
consider both the much- cited potential of social media for science
communication and the reality of its yet-nascent acceptance among
faculty members—especially those in senior positions. For policymakers
it is imperative to have an accurate picture of the situation and the
immediate future, beyond lofty promises. It is exceedingly likely that
in those areas where change is occurring because it is being driven, at
least in part, by researchers themselves, the changes will be more
lasting than where new technologies are not well-integrated into
established practices. Further factors able to spur innovation are
payback in the form of funding, increased reputation, and other critical
competitive aspects of institutional science. Yet it remains unproven
whether social media tools are essential to improving scholarly
communication or whether their usefulness is restricted to the margin of
science and scholarship, rather than extending to the center.

Two key components that could facilitate the success of social media
tools (blogging, microblogging, but also wikis and social networking
sites for scientists) are the spread of alternative means of measuring
scientific impact beyond traditional bibliometric indicators (a) and the
increasing adaptation of social media formats for science and
integration into “proper” scientific discourse (b). The former is at the
focus of innovations in scientometrics and initial suggestions are
likely to be made in the coming years to funders and research
organizations about how to measure impact more holistically, though it
remains to be seen whether established (and widely criticized) measures
such as *Thompson* Scientific’s Impact Factor (IF) can be displaced. In
order to achieve the latter, the institutional enablers of science
communication—publishers, libraries, science organizations and scholarly
societies—will have to invent not only new technologies, but also
rebrand familiar labels that scientists rely on. The French site
*Hypotheses.org* and the lab platform *OpenWetWare.org* are examples of
this approach: while the former is a technically a blog platform based
on the popular Wordpress software and the latter is a wiki based on
*Wikimedia’s MediaWiki*, both clearly present themselves as pieces of
scientific infrastructure, built for an academic audience. Success in
these approaches lies not in engaging with the “newness” of social media
to win skeptics over, but in promising that social media tools can be
adapted to achieve similar aims as were previously realized through
other channels, only quicker, cheaper and with broader effect.

The current consensus among scientists appears to be that blogs and
*Twitter* are somewhat interesting to promote one’s own research (to
journalists and perhaps a few colleagues), and more broadly, one’s field
(to potential students, the general public), but that the payoff is not
always worth the time and effort (Bader, Fritz, & Gloning 2012). If
science was solely concerned with getting scholarly content across to as
many people as possible, blogs would have displaced the established
system of academic publishing by now, but it is no coincidence that the
journal article has not been abandoned in favor of the blog post. In
addition to overall conservatism, the lack of peer review in social
media channels also hampers its adoption as a replacement for
traditional publications. Scholarly content, regardless of the
discipline, must be valorized by the judgement of others, and frequently
only after the criticism of peers has been taken into account and the
original manuscript has been adjusted is a piece of writing deemed a
genuine scholarly publication. Time is the scarcest resource in research
and investing it in an activity of peripheral importance is widely
regarded as wasteful. Taking the extreme goal-orientedness of scholarly
communication into account is essential in understanding the perceived
advantages and disadvantages of social media in the minds of many
scientists.

## What is the Potential of Blogs and Twitter for the Future of Science?

A comparably small number of people across the globe actively works on
complex scientific issues, communicating through channels and genres
established over the course of decades, or in some cases centuries,
which have been carefully designed to suit the needs of the respective
communities. How can those on the outside reasonably argue for the need
to profoundly change such a system without professing their own status
as outsiders? The underlying claim of those challenging science to be
more open is that it is closed to begin with, a perception not
universally shared by scientists. Those who espouse the view that social
media should be used to discuss scientific research tend to fall into
one of either two camps: adaptionists or revolutionaries. Adaptionists
believe that social media tools need to suit researchers needs in doing
what they are already doing. Hard adaptationists believe that new
formats should replace established ones because they are more efficient,
cheaper, faster, and better than the established formats of
institutionalized academia (e.g. that blog posts should replace journal
articles). Soft adaptionists believe that new forms should augment
existing ones, often filling unaddressed needs. A soft adaptionist would
use *Twitter* to promote his research, but not publish a paper in his
blog rather than *Nature*. In practice, most adaptionists probably act
as soft adaptionists, but some would prefer to follow the hard,
uncompromising route if they could. Adaptionists have in common the
basic belief in the legitimacy and relevance of the existing system of
institutional science, but see it as being in need of reform. They
believe that certain aspects of the system need change, but are
convinced of its overall soundness. Revolutionaries, by contrast, call
more than just specific aspects of the system (e.g. publishing) into
question, being, in fact, opposed to the system as such, which they
perceive as elitist and deeply flawed. While to the adaptationists
science is fundamentally open, it is fundamentally closed to the
revolutionaries, who are rarely themselves part of the entrenched
academic system, but tend to be either junior faculty members or
amateurs. Whereas the adaptationists have been co-opted to varying
degrees to uphold the established order, the revolutionaries imagine a
future in which the the entrenched system is overturned. Though the
latter seems much less likely than the former, both groups actively
advance the significance of social media for science, in spite of
widespread inertia on the part of much of the academic establishment.

It has yet to be seen how exactly blogs will fit into the existing
ecosystem of scholarly publishing. Their role could be complementary,
providing an outlet for purposes which traditional publishing does not
address—from reflections about teaching to the promotion of a
researcher’s work. Miscellaneous writing that does not fit into
recognized publications however is strongly contingent on the time that
a researcher has at their disposal. Blogging on a regular basis is
time-consuming, therefore it is likely that full-time academics will
actively blog only if they find it benefits their career. In the end,
blogs and microblogs supplement, rather than replace, traditional
formats, and act as tools for the promotion of one’s research, rather
than tokens of prestige and academic excellence. Changing blogs in order
to make them functionally equivalent to recognized formal publications
would mean changing them to a degree that could nullify their benefits
(for example, by introducing peer review). Instead, they have a place in
the larger ecosystem of science communication 2.0 which includes
protocols (*OpenWetWare*) and workflows (*myExperiment*) as examples of
entirely new scientific genres which are functionally different from
blog posts.
