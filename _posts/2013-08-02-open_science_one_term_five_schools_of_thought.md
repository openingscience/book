  Open Science is an umbrella term encompassing a multitude of assumptions
  about the future of knowledge creation and dissemination. Based on a
  literature review, this chapter aims at structuring the overall discourse by
  proposing five Open Science schools of thought: The *infrastructure school*
  (which is concerned with the technological architecture), the *public school*
  (which is concerned with the accessibility of knowledge creation), the
  \"measurement school\"(which is concerned with alternative impact
  measurement), the \"democratic school\"(which is concerned with access to
  knowledge) and the \"pragmatic school\" (which is concerned with
  collaborative research).

There is scarcely a scientist who has not stumbled upon the term ‘Open
Science’ of late and there is hardly a scientific conference where the
word and its meaning are not discussed in some form or other. ‘Open
Science’ is one of the buzzwords of the scientific community. Moreover,
it is accompanied by a vivid discourse that apparently encompasses any
kind of change in relation to the future of scientific knowledge
creation and dissemination; a discourse whose lowest common denominator
is perhaps that science in the near future somehow needs to open up
more. In fact, the very same term evokes quite different understandings
and opens a multitude of battlefields, ranging from the democratic right
to access publicly funded knowledge (e.g. open access to publications)
or the demand for a better bridging of the divide between research and
society (e.g. citizen science) to the development of freely available
tools for collaboration (e.g. social media platforms for scientists).
From this vantage point, openness could refer to pretty much anything:
The process of knowledge creation, its result, the researching
individual him- or herself, or the relationship between research and the
rest of society.

The diversity, and perhaps ambiguity, of the discourse is, however,
understandable considering the diversity of stakeholders that are
directly affected by a changing scientific environment. These are in the
first place: Researchers from all fields, policy makers, platform
programmers and operators, publishers, and the interested public. It
appears that each peer group discussing the term has a different
understanding of the meaning and application of Open Science. As such
the whole discourse can come across as somewhat confusing. By
structuring the Open Science discourse on the basis of existing
literature, we would like to offer an overview of the multiple
directions of development of this still young discourse, its main
arguments, and common catchphrases. Furthermore, we intend to indicate
issues that in our eyes still require closer attention.

Looking at the relevant literature on Open Science, one can in fact
recognize iterative motives and patterns of argumentation that, in our
opinion, form more or less distinct streams. Referring to the diversity
of these streams, we allowed ourselves to call them schools of thought.
After dutifully combing through the literature on Open Science, we
identified five distinct schools of thought. We do not claim a
consistently clear-cut distinction between these schools (in fact some
share certain ontological principles). We do, however, believe that our
compilation can give a comprehensible overview of the predominant
thought patterns in the current Open Science discourse and point towards
new directions in research regarding Open Science. In terms of a
literature review, we furthermore hope that this chapter identifies some
of the leading scholars and thinkers within the five schools.

The following table (table 1) comprises the five identified schools together with
their central assumptions, the involved stakeholder groups, their aims,
and the tools and methods used to achieve and promote these aims.

It must be noted that our review is not solely built upon traditional
scholarly publications but, due to the nature of the topic, also
includes scientific blogs and newspaper articles. It is our aim in this
chapter to present a concise picture of the ongoing discussion rather
than a complete list of peer-reviewed articles on the topic. In the
following, we will describe the five schools in more detail and provide
references to relevant literature for each.


## Public School: The Obligation to Make Science Accessible to the Public

In a nutshell, advocates of the public school argue that science needs
to be accessible for a wider audience. The basic assumption herein is
that the social web and Web 2.0 technologies allow scientists, on the
one hand, to open up the research process and, on the other, to prepare
the product of their research for interested non-experts (see table 2).

Accordingly, we recognize two different streams within the public
school: The first is concerned with the accessibility of the research
process (the production), the second with the comprehensibility of the
research result (the product). Both streams involve the relationship
between scientists and the public and define openness as a form of
devotion to a wider audience. In the following section we will elaborate
more on both streams in reference to relevant literature.

### Accessibility to the Research Process — Can Anyone be a Scientist?

To view the issue as a formerly hidden research process becoming
transparent and accessible to the common man seems a decidedly romantic
image of doing science. Yet, coming from the assumptions that
communication technology not only allows the constant documentation of
research, but also the inclusion of dispersed external individuals (as
supposed in the pragmatic school), an obvious inference is that the
formerly excluded public can now play a more active role in research. A
pervasive catchphrase in this relationship is the concept of so-called
citizen science which, put simply, describes the participation of
non-scientists and amateurs in research. Admittedly, the term, as well
as the idea, have already existed for a long time. In 1978, well before
the digital age, the biochemist Erwin Chargaff already used this term to
espouse a form of science that is dominated by dedicated amateurs.''
''The meaning of the term has not changed; it merely experiences a new
magnitude in the light of modern communication technology.

Hand (2010) refers, for instance, to Rosetta@Home, a
distributed-computing project in which volunteer users provide their
computing power (while it is not in use) to virtually fold proteins. The
necessary software for this also allowed users to watch how their
computer tugged and twisted the protein in search of a suitable
configuration (ibid., p.2). By observing this, numerous users came up
with suggestions to speed up the otherwise slow process. Reacting to the
unexpected user involvement, the research team applied a new interface
to the program that allowed users to assist in the folding in form of an
online game called Foldit. Hand states: *“By harnessing human brains for
problem solving, Foldit takes BOINC’s distributed-computing concept to a
whole new level”* (ibid., p. 2). In this specific case, the inclusion of
citizens leads to a faster research process on a large public scale.
Citizen science is in this regard a promising tool to ‘harness’ a
volunteer workforce. However, one can arguably question the actual
quality of the influence of amateurs upon the analytical part of the
research research. Catlin-Groves (2012) takes the same line as the
Rosetta@Home project. She expects citizen science’s greatest potential
in the monitoring of ecology or biodiversity at a large scale (ibid., p.
2). The specific fields possibly issue from the author’s area of
research (Natural Sciences) and the journal in which the review article
was published (International Journal of Zoology). Nonetheless, in
respect to the two fields, it becomes apparent that citizens can rather
be considered a mass volunteer workforce instead of actual scientists.

Indeed, most citizen science projects follow a top-down logic in which
professional scientists give impetuses, take on leading roles in the
process and analysis, and use amateurs not as partners, but rather as a
free workforce. Irwin (2006) even claims that most citizen science
projects are not likely to provide amateurs with the skills and
capacities to significantly affect research in meaningful ways. Powell
and Colin (2009) also criticize the lack of a meaningful impact for
non-experts in the research: *“Most participatory exercises do not
engage citizens beyond an event or a few weeks/months, and they do not
build citizens’ participatory skills in ways that would help them engage
with scientists or policy makers independently”* (ibid., p. 327).

The authors further present their own citizen science project, the
Nanoscale Science & Engineering Center (NSEC), which at first also
started as a onetime event. After the project was finished, however, the
University engaged a citizen scientist group which is in frequent
dialogue with field experts. The authors do not lay out in detail how
citizens can actually influence research policies, rather present a
perspective for a bottom-up relationship between interested amateurs and
professionals. There is still a lack of research when it comes to models
of active involvement of citizens in the research process beyond feeder
services. Future research could therefore focus on new areas of citizen
participation (e.g. citizen science in ‘soft sciences’) or alternative
organizational models for citizen science (e.g. how much top-down
organization is necessary?).

Another, also yet to explored, aspect that can be associated with
citizen science is the crowdfunding of science. Crowdfunding is a
financing principle that is already well established in the creative
industries. Via online platforms, single Internet users can contribute
money to project proposals of their choice and, if the project receives
enough funding, enable their realization. Contributions are often
rewarded with non-monetary benefits for the benefactors. A similar model
is conceivable for science: The public finances research proposals
directly through monetary contributions and in return receives a benefit
of some description (for instance: access to the results). Crowdfunding
of science allows direct public influence on the very outskirts of the
research (a kind of civic scientific agenda setting) yet hardly at all
during the process. Nonetheless, it possibly constitutes a new decisive
force in the pursuit of research interests besides the “classica” of
institutional and private funding. There is still, at least to the
authors’ knowledge, no research regarding this topic. Future research
could for instance cover factors of success for project pitches or the
actual potential of crowdfunding for science.

### Comprehensibility of the Research Result—Making Science Understandable

The second stream of the public school refers to the comprehensibility
of science for a wider audience, that is mainly science communication.
Whereas, for instance, citizen science concerns the public influence on
the research, this sub-stream concerns the scientists’ obligation to
make research understandable for a wider audience—a demand that Tacke
(2011), in an entry on his blog, provocatively entitled *“Come out of
the ivory tower!”*.

In this regard, Cribb and Sari demand a change in the scientific writing
style: “*Science is by nature complicated, making it all the more
important that good science writing should be simple, clean and clear*”
(2010, p. 15). The authors’ credo is that as the scientific audience
becomes broader and the topics more specific, the academic dissemination
of knowledge needs to adapt.

On a perhaps more applied level, numerous authors suggest specific tools
for science communication. Puschmann and Weller (2011), for instance,
describe the microblogging service Twitter as a suitable tool to direct
users to, for example, relevant literature and as a source for
alternative impact factors (as expressed in the measurement school). In
this volume (see chapter 6: Micro(blogging) Science? Notes on Potentials
and Constraints of New Forms of Scholarly Communication), Puschmann
furthermore dwells on the role of the scientist today and his need to
communicate: “*Scientists must be able to explain what they do to a
broader public to garner political support and funding for endeavors
whose outcomes are unclear at best and dangerous at worst, a difficulty
that is magnified by the complexity of scientific issues”.* As adequate
tools for the new form of scholarly public justification, the author
refers to scientific blogging or Twitter during conferences. In the same
line of reasoning, Grand (2012) argues that by using Web 2.0 tools and
committing to public interaction, a researcher can become a public
figure and honest broker of his or her information (ibid., p. 684).

While numerous researchers already focus on the new tools and formats of
science communication and the audience’s expectations, there is still a
need for research on the changing role of a researcher in a digital
society, that is, for instance, the dealings with a new form of public
pressure to justify the need for instant communication and the ability
to format one’s research for the public. A tenable question is thus also
if a researcher can actually meet the challenge to, on the one hand,
carry out research on highly complex issues and, on the other, prepare
these in easily digestible bits of information. Or is there rather an
emerging market for brokers and mediators of academic knowledge?
Besides, what are the dangers of preparing research results in easily
digestible formats?

## Democratic School: Making Research Products Available

The democratic school is concerned with the concept of access to
knowledge. Unlike the public school, which promotes accessibility in
terms of participation to research and its comprehensibility, advocates
of the democratic school focus on the principal access to the products
of research. This mostly relates to research publications and scientific
data, but also to source materials, digital representations of pictorial
and graphical materials, or multimedia material (as Sitek and Bertelmann
describe it their chapter).

Put simply, they argue that any research product should be freely
available. The reason we refer to the discourse about free access to
research products as the democratic school issues from its inherent
rationale that everyone should have the equal right to access knowledge,
especially when it is state-funded.

In the following, we will focus on two central streams of the democratic
school, namely open access to research publications and Open Data. We
assume that both represent a wider set of arguments that accompanies
discussion on free access to research products.

### Open Data

Regarding Open Data in science, Murray-Rust (2008, p. 52) relates the
meaning of the prefix ‘open’ to the common definition of open source
software. In that understanding, the right of usage of scientific data
does not demise to an academic journal but remains in the scientific
community: *“I felt strongly that data of this sort should by right
belong to the community and not to the publisher and started to draw
attention to the problem”* (ibid., p. 54). According to Murray-Rust, it
is obstructive that journals claim copyright for supporting information
(often data) of an article and thereby prevent the potential reuse of
the data. He argues that “*(it) is important to realize that SI is
almost always completely produced by the original authors and, in many
cases, is a direct output from a computer. The reviewers may use the
data for assessing the validity of the science in the publication but I
know of no cases where an editor has required the editing of (supporting
information)*” (ibid., p. 53). The author endorses that text, data or
meta-data can be re-used for whatever purpose without further explicit
permission from a journal (see table 3). He assumes that, other than validating
research, journals have no use for claiming possession over supporting
information—other researchers, however, do.

According to Murray-Rust’s understanding, data should not be ‘free’ (as
in free beer), but open for re-use in studies foreseen or unforeseen by
the original creator. The rationale behind Open Data in science is in
this case researcher-centric; it is a conjuncture that fosters
meaningful data mining and aggregation of data from multiple papers. Put
more simply, Open Data allows research synergies and prevents
duplication in the collection of data. In this regard, Murray-Rust does
not only criticize the current journal system and the withholding of
supporting information but also intimates at the productive potential of
Open Data. It has to be said, though, that the synergy potentials that
Murray-Rust describes mostly apply to natural sciences (or at least
research fields in which data is more or less standardized) or at least
fields in which an intermediate research product (e.g. data) can be of
productive use for others.

Similar to Murray-Rust, Molloy (2011) criticises the current journal
system which, according to the author, works against the maximum
dissemination of scientific data that underlies publications. She
elaborates on the barriers inherent in the current journal system thus:
“*Barriers include inability to access data, restrictions on usage
applied by publishers or data providers, and publication of data that is
difficult to reuse, for example, because it is poorly annotated or*
‘*hidden*’'' in unmodifiable tables like PDF documents*”* ''(ibid, p.
1). She suggests a dealing with data that follows the Open Knowledge
Foundation’s definition of openness, meaning that the data in question
should be available as a whole, at no more than a reasonable
reproduction cost (preferably through download), and in a convenient and
modifiable form.

Other than Murray-Rust (2008) and Molloy (2011), Vision (2010), and
Boulton (2011) firstly hold the researchers liable for practicing Open
Data. Vision refers to a study by Campbell et al. (2002), in which it is
shown that only one quarter of scientists share their research data—even
upon request. According to the study, the most common reason for denying
requests was the amount of effort required for compliance. Vision
presents disciplinary data repositories that are maintained by the data
creators themselves as an appropriate solution to the problem. This way,
scientists would only need to upload their data once instead of
complying with requests. Although Vision emphasizes the necessity to
minimize the submission burden for the author, he does not suggest
concrete inducements for scientists to upload their data (for instance
forms of community recognition or other material rewards). In an
empirical study about the sharing behavior among scientists, Haeussler
found out that the sharing of data is indeed closely related to a form
of counter-value (Haeussler, 2011, p. 8).

Who is to blame for the fact that Open Data has not yet achieved its
breakthrough despite its potential? Is it the journal system and its
supporting information practice? Researchers and their reluctance to
share? Missing incentive systems? Or overcomplicated data repositories?
The apparent divergence regarding the impediments of Open Data
demonstrates the need for further empirical research on this issue.
Future studies could address the reluctance of researchers to practice
Open Data, the role of journals and supporting material, or the design
of an appropriate online data repository or meta-data structures for
research data. The implied multitude of obstacles for practicing Open
Data also illustrates that research on this issue needs to be holistic.

-------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes the open access of research publications, the argument is
often less researcher-centric. Cribb and Sari (2010) make the case for
the open access to scientific knowledge as a human right (see table 4). According to
them, there is a gap between the creation and the sharing of knowledge:
While scientific knowledge doubles every 5 years, the access to this
knowledge remains limited—leaving parts of the world in the dark: “*As
humanity progresses through the 21st century (...) many scholars point
to the emergence of a disturbing trend: the world is dividing into those
with ready access to knowledge and its fruit, and those without.*”
(ibid., p. 3). For them, free access to knowledge is a necessity for
human development. In a study on open access in library and information
science, Rufai et al. (2011) take the same line. They assume that
countries *“falling in the low-income economic zones have to come on
open access canvas”* (ibid., 2011, p. 225). In times of financial
crises, open journal systems and consequently equal access to knowledge
could be an appropriate solution. Additionally, Phelps et al. (2012)
regard open access to research publications as a catalyst for
development, whereas limited access to a small subset of people with
subscription is a hindrance to development. Consistently, they define
open access as “*the widest possible dissemination of information*”
(ibid., p. 1).

Apart from the developmental justification, Phelps et al. (2012) mention
another, quite common, logic for open access to research publications:
“*It is argued (...) that research funded by tax-payers should be made
available to the public free of charge so that the tax-payer does not in
effect pay twice for the research (...)*” (ibid., p.1). ‘Paying twice
for research’ refers to the fact that citizens do not only indirectly
finance government-funded research but also the subsequent acquisition
of publications from public libraries.

Carroll (2011) also criticizes the inefficiency of traditional,
subscription-financed scientific journals in times of growth in digital
technologies and networks. He argues that prices should have dropped
considerably in the light of the Internet—instead they have increased
drastically. He further argues that the open access model would shift
the balance of power in journal publishing and greatly enhance the
efficiency and efficacy of scientific communication (ibid., p. 1). By
shifting the financing away from subscriptions, the open access model
re-aligns copyright and enables broad reuse of publications while at the
same time assuring authors and publishers that they receive credit for
their effort (e.g. through open licensing).

## Pragmatic School: Making Research More Efficient

Advocates of the pragmatic school regard Open Science as a method to
make research and knowledge dissemination more efficient. It thereby
considers science as a process that can be optimized by, for instance,
modularizing the process of knowledge creation, opening the scientific
value chain, including external knowledge and allowing collaboration
through online tools. The notion of ‘open’ follows in this regard very
much the disclosed production process known from open innovation
concepts (see table 5).

Tacke (2010) for instance builds upon the connection between open
innovation and Open Science. Similar to open innovation, the author
applies the outside-in (including external knowledge to the production
process) and inside-out (spillovers from the formerly closed production
process) principles to science. He regards Web 2.0 in this regard as a
fertile ground for practicing collaborative research (ibid., p. 41) and
emphasizes the ‘wisdom of the crowds’ as a necessity in solving today’s
scientific problems: “*Taking a closer look at science reveals a similar
situation: problems have become more complex and often require a joint
effort in order to find a solution*” (ibid., p. 37).

Tacke refers to Hunter and Leahey (2008) who examined trends in
collaboration over a 70 years period. They found out that between 1935
and 1940 only 11 % of the observed articles were co-authored, whereas
between 2000 and 2005 almost 50 % were coauthored—a significant increase
that according to Tacke issues from the increasing complexity of
research problems over time; research problems that apparently can only
be solved through multi-expert consideration. Indeed, Bozeman and Corley
(2004) found out in an empirical study on researcher collaboration that
some of the most frequent reasons for collaborative research are access
to expertise, aggregation of different kinds of knowledge, and
productivity. Apart from the assumed increasing complexity of today’s
research problems and the researcher’s pursuit of productivity, Tacke
also points out the technical progress that enables and fosters
collaboration in the first place. The Web 2.0 allows virtually anyone to
participate in the process of knowledge creation (ibid., p. 4). It is
thus tenable to consider, besides the strive for productivity and the
increasing complexity of research process, also the emerging
communication and collaboration technology as a solid reason for
collaborative research.

Nielsen (2012) argues accordingly. He proceeds from the assumption that
openness indicates a pivotal shift in the scientific practice in the
near future—namely from closed to collaborative. Through reference to
numerous examples of collective intelligence, such as the Polymath
Project (in which Tim Gower posted a mathematical problem on his blog
that was then solved by a few experts) or the Galaxy Zoo Project (an
online astronomy project which amateurs can join to assist morphological
classification), he emphasizes the crucial role of online tools in this
development: “*Superficially, the idea that online tools can make us
collectively smarter contradicts the idea, currently fashionable in some
circles, that the Internet is reducing our intelligence*” (ibid., p.
26).

Nielsen’s presentation of examples for collaborative knowledge
discoveries permits conjecture on the wide variety of collaborative
research when it comes to scale and quality—be it a rather-small scale
expert collaboration as in the Polymath project or large-scale amateur
collaboration as in the Galaxy Zoo project. Nielsen also points towards
the importance of Open Data (ibid., p. 101) and promotes comprehensive
scientific commons: “*We need to imagine a world where the construction
of the scientific information commons has come to fruition. This is a
world where all scientific knowledge has been made available online, and
is expressed in a way that can be understood by computers*” (ibid., p.
111). It becomes obvious that Nielsen’s vision of Open Science is based
on vesting conditions like the enhanced use of online platforms, the
inclusion of non-experts in the discovery process and, not least, the
willingness to share on the part of scientists; all of which show that
Nielsen’s notion of collective research is also bound to numerous
profound changes in the scientific practice—not to mention the
technological ability to understand all formats of knowledge by
computers.

Haeussler (2011) addresses the sharing behaviour of researchers in an
empirical study among scientists. She uses arguments from social capital
theory in order to explain why individuals share information even at
(temporary) personal cost. Her notion of Open Science is thereby
strongly bound to the free sharing of information (similar to one of
Nielsen’s core requirements for Open Science). One of Haeussler’s
results concerns the competitive value of information. She concludes:
“*My study showed that factors related to social capital influence the
impact of the competitive value of the requested information on a
scientist’s decision to share or withhold information.*” (ibid., p.
117). If academic scientists expect the inquirer to be able to return
the favor, they are much more likely to share information. Haeussler’s
study shows that the scientist’s sharing behaviour is not altruistic per
se —which is often taken for granted in texts on Open Science. Instead,
it is rather built on an, even non-monetary, system of return. The
findings raise the question as to how the sharing of information and
thus, at least according to Nielsen and Haeussler, a basic requirement
for Open Science could be expedited. It implies that a change in
scientific practice comes with fundamental changes in the culture of
science ; in this case the incentives to share information.

Neylon and Wu (2009), in a general text on the requirements for Open
Science, elaborate more on Web 2.0 tools that facilitate and accelerate
scientific discovery. According to them, tools “*whether they be
social networking sites, electronic laboratory notebooks, or controlled
vocabularies, must be built to help scientists do what they are already
doing, not what the tool designer feels they should be doing*” (ibid.,
p. 543). The authors thereby regard the implementation of Web 2.0 tools
in close relation to the existing scientific practice. Following this,
scientific tools can only foster scientific discovery if they tie in
with the research practice. The most obvious target, according to the
authors, is in this regard ''“tools that make it easier to capture the
research record so that it can be incorporated into and linked from
papers” ''(ibid., p. 543). Unfortunately, the authors do not further
elaborate on how potential tools could be integrated in the researchers’
work flows. Nonetheless, they take a new point of view when it comes to
the role of Web 2.0 tools and the necessity to integrate these into an
existing research practice. In this regard, they differ from what we
subsume as the infrastructure school.

The authors mentioned in this chapter reveal visionary perspectives on
scientific practice in the age of Web 2.0. Nonetheless, we assume that
further research must focus on the structural requirements of Open
Science, the potential incentives for scientists to share information,
or the potential inclusion of software tools in the existing practice.
In other words: The assumed coherence in regard to Open Science still
lacks empirical research.

## Infrastructure School: Architecture Matters Most

The infrastructure school is concerned with the technical infrastructure
that enables emerging research practices on the Internet, for the most
part software tools and applications, as well as computing networks. In
a nutshell, the infrastructure school regards Open Science as a
technological challenge (see table 6). Literature on this matter is therefore often
practice-oriented and case-specific; it focuses on the technological
requirements that facilitate particular research practices (e.g. the
Open Science Grid).

In 2003, Nentwich (2003, p. 1) coined the term cyberscience to describe
the trend of applying information and communication technologies to
scientific research—a development that has prospered since then. The
authors locate cyberscience in a Web 2.0 context, alluding not only to
the technical progress that fosters collaboration and interaction among
scientists, but also to a cultural change similar to the open source
development. Most Open Science practices described in the previously
discussed schools have to be very much understood as a part of an
interplay between individuals and the tools at hand. The technical
infrastructure is in this regard a cyclic element for almost all
identified schools in this chapter; imagine Open Data without online
data repositories or collaborative writing without web-based real-time
editors. In one way or another it is the new technological possibilities
that change established scientific practices or even constitute new
ones, as in the case of altmetrics or scientific blogging.

Still, we decided to include the infrastructure school as a separate and
superordinate school of thought due to discernible infrastructure trends
in the context of Open Science; trends that in our eyes enable research
on a different scale. We will therefore not list the multitude of Open
Science projects and their technological infrastructure but instead
dwell on two infrastructure trends and selected examples. It has to be
said that these trends are not mutually exclusive but often interwoven.
The trends are:

-   Distributed computing: Using the computing power of many users for
    research
-   Social and collaboration networks for scientists: Enabling
    researcher interaction and collaboration

### Distributed Computing

A striking example for distributed computing in science is the Open
Science Grid, ''“a large distributed computational infrastructure in the
United States, which supports many different high-throughput scientific
applications (...) to form multi-domain integrated distributed systems
for science.” ''(Altunay et al. 2011, p. 201). Put simply, the Open
Science Grid enables large-scale, data-intensive research projects by
connecting multiple computers to a high-performance computer network.
Autonomous computers are interconnected in order to achieve
high-throughput research goals. The Open Science Grid provides a
collaborative research environment for communities of scientists and
researchers to work together on distributed computing problems (ibid.,
p. 202).

It is thus not completely accurate to confine the Open Science Grid to
its computational power alone as it also provides access to storage
resources, offers a software stack, and uses common operational
services. Nonetheless, its core strength resides in the computational
power of many single computers, allowing scientists to realize
data-intensive research projects, high throughput processing and shared
storage. Typical projects that use the Open Science Grid are therefore
CPU-intensive, comprise a large number of independent jobs, demand a
significant amount of database-access, and/or implicate large input and
output data from remote servers.

Foster encapsulates the increasing importance of grids as an essential
computing infrastructure: “''Driven by increasingly complex problems and
by advances in understanding and technique, and powered by the emergence
of the Internet (...), today’s science is as much based on computation,
data analysis, and collaboration as on the efforts of individual
experimentalists and theorists.” ''(2003, p. 52). Foster (ibid.) further
emphasizes the potential to enable large-scale sharing of resources
within distributed, often loosely coordinated and virtual groups—an idea
that according to the author is not all new. He refers to a case from
1968, when designers of the Multics operating system envisioned a
computer facility operating as a utility (ibid, p. 52). What is new
though, according to Foster, is the performance of such network
utilities in the light of technological progress (ibid., p. 53).

Distributed computing allows scientists to realize research almost
independently from the individual computing resources. It is thereby an
opportunity to untie a researcher from locally available resources by
providing a highly efficient computer network. Considering the
importance of big data, scientific computing will be an essential
research infrastructure in the near future. One could say that the
objective of scientific computing is the increase of performance by
interconnecting many autonomous and dispersed computers.

### Social and Collaboration Networks

A second, more researcher-centric, infrastructure trend focuses on
platforms that foster interaction between locally dispersed individuals
and allow collaboration by implementing Web 2.0 tools. Drawing on the
example of myExperiment, De Roure et al. (2008) propose four key
capabilities of what they consider a Social Virtual Research Environment
(SVRE):

* According to the authors, a SVRE should *firstly* facilitate the
  management and sharing of research objects. These can be any digital
  commodities that are used and reused by researchers (e.g. methods
  and data).
* *Secondly*, it should have incentives for researchers to make their
  research objects available.
* *Thirdly*, the environment should be open and extensible—meaning
  that software, tools and services can be easily integrated.
* *Fourthly*, it should provide a platform to action research.
  Actioning research is, in the authors’ understanding, what makes a
  platform an actual research environment. Research objects are in
  this regard not just stored and exchanged but they are used in the
  conduct of research (De Roure 2008, p. 182).

This depiction of a SVRE does of course not exclude mass computation
(the third capability in fact endorses the integration of additional
services)—it does, however, clearly focus on the interaction and
collaboration between researchers. Furthermore, it becomes apparent that
the authors’ notion of ‘virtual social research’ involves a multitude of
additional tools and services enabling collaborative research. It
implies (directly or indirectly) the existence of integrated large-scale
data repositories that allow researchers to make their data publicly
available in the first place.

Nentwich and König (2012, p. 42), who are also featured in this book,
point towards other social networks for scientists, such as
ResearchGate, Mendeley, Nature Networks, Vivo, or Academia.edu. The
authors state that present academic social networks are principally
functional for scientists and do not (yet) feature a convergence towards
one provider. They further point towards the use of multi-purpose social
networks (such as Facebook, LinkedIN, or Xing) among scientists. These
are used for thematic expert groups (not only scientists),
self-marketing, or job exchange. In the chapter “Academia Goes
Facebook?: The Potential of Social Network Sites in the Scholarly
Realm”, the authors elaborate more on the role of social networks for
scientists—including tools for scientific collaboration such as
collaborative writing environments.

## Measurement School: Finding Alternative Measurements for Scientific Output

The measurement school is concerned with alternative standards to
ascertain scientific impact. Inarguably, the impact factor, which
measures the average number of citations to an article in a journal, has
a decisive influence on a researcher’s reputation and thereby his or her
funding and career opportunities. It is therefore hardly surprising that
a discourse about Open Science and how science will be done in the
future is accompanied by the crucial question as to how scientific
impact can be measured in the digital age.

Advocates of the Open Science measurement school express the following
concerns about the current impact factor:

* The peer review is time-consuming. (McVeigh 2004; Priem & Costello, 2010)
* The impact is linked to a journal rather than directly to an
  article. (McVeigh 2004)
* New publishing formats (e.g. online open access journals, blogs) are
  seldom in a journal format to which an impact factor can be assigned
  to (Weller & Puschmann 2012; Priem et al. 2012; Yeong & Abdullah 2012)

Accordingly, this school argues the case for an alternative and faster
impact measurement that includes other forms of publication and the
social web coverage of a scientific contribution. The general credo is:
As the scholarly workflow is migrates increasingly to the web, formerly
hidden uses like reading, bookmarking, sharing, discussing, and rating
are leaving traces online and offer a new basis by which to measure
scientific impact. The umbrella term for these new impact measurements
is altmetrics (see table 7).

Yeong and Abdullah (2012) state that altmetrics differ from webometrics
which are, as the authors argue, relatively slow, unstructured, and
closed. Altmetrics instead rely upon a wider set of measures that
includes tweets, blogs, discussions, and bookmarks (e.g. mendeley.com).
Altmetrics measure different forms of significance and usage patterns by
looking not just at the end publication, but also the process of
research and collaboration (ibid., p. 2). Unfortunately, the authors do
not further outline how a scientific process instead of a product could
be evaluated. A possibility could be to measure the impact of emerging
formats of research documentation in the social web (e.g. scientific
blogs) or datasets (e.g. Open Data).

As a possible basis for altmetrics, Priem et al. (2011, p. 1) mention
web pages, blogs, and downloads, but also social media like Twitter, or
social reference managers like CiteULike, Mendeley, and Zotero. As a
result of a case study with 214 articles, they present the two
open-source online tools, CitedIn and Total Impact, as potential
alternatives to measure scientific impact as they are based on a
meaningful amount of data from more diverse academic publications. At
the same time, they emphasize that there is still a need for research
regarding the comparability of altmetrics, which is difficult due to the
high dimensionality of altmetrics data.

While many authors already recognize the need for new metrics in the
digital age and a more structured and rapid alternative to webometrics
(Young et al. 2012), research on this matter is still in its infancy.
There is scarcely any research on the comparability of altmetrics and
virtually no research on their potential manipulations and network
effects. Furthermore, altmetrics are not yet broadly applied in the
scientific community, raising the question as to what hinders their
broad implementation. A possible reason is the tight coupling of the
existing journal system and its essential functions of archiving,
registration, dissemination, and certification of scholarly knowledge
(Priem & Hemminger 2012). All the more, it appears that future research
should also focus on the overall process of science, its transformative
powers, and, likewise, constraints.

## Discussion

This chapter showed that “Open Science” is an umbrella term that
encompasses almost any dispute about the future of knowledge creation
and dissemination, a term that evokes quite different understandings
depending on the viewpoint of its respective advocates and leads to many
quarrels under the same flag—yet with varying inducements and targets.
Even though the chapter implies a certain lack of conceptual clarity in
the term Open Science, we do not promote a precisely defined concept. On
the contrary, we assume that doing so could prevent fertile discussions
from the very beginning. We therefore aimed at offering an overview of
the leading discourses by suggesting five (more or less) distinct
schools of thought, and their core aims and argumentations. We suggest
that this classification can be a starting point for structuring the
overall discourse and locating its common catchphrases and
argumentations. In this respect the mindmap graphic below attempts to
arrange the most common keywords in the Open Science discourse according
to the aforegoing described schools.

Although Open Science covers in the broadest sense anything about the
future of knowledge creation and dissemination, not necessarily all
developments described in this chapter are novel. In fact, many demands
and argumentations existed long before the dawn of the Internet and the
digital age. Some would even argue that science is per definition open,
since the aim of research is, after all, to publish its results, and as
such *to make knowledge public*. Nonetheless, science certainly has
experienced a new dynamic in the light of modern communication
technology. Collaborative forms of research, the increasing number of
co-authored scientific articles, new publication formats in the social
web, the wide range of online research tools, and the emergence of open
access journals all bear witness to what is entitled in this book ‘the
dawn of a new era’.

Science is doubtlessly faced with enormous challenges in the coming
years. New approaches to knowledge creation and dissemination go hand in
hand with profound systemic changes (e.g. when it comes to scientific
impact), changes in the daily practice of researchers (e.g. when it
comes to new tools and methods), changes in the publishing industry
(e.g. when it comes to coping with alternative publication formats), and
many more. In this regard, this chapter should not only provide insight
into the wide range of developments in the different Open Science
schools, but also point towards the complexity of the change, the
intertwinedness of the developments, and thus the necessity for holistic
approaches in research on the future of research. For example: How could
one argue for extensive practicing of Open Data if there is no
remuneration for those who do it? How could one expect a researcher to
work collaboratively online if platforms are too complicated to use? Why
should a researcher invest time and effort in writing a blog if it has
no impact on his or her reputation?

The entirety of the outlined developments in this chapter marks a
profound change of the scientific environment. Yet even if the most
prominent accompaniments of this change (be it open access, Open Data,
citizen science, or collaborative research) are possibly overdue for a
knowledge industry in the digital age and welcomed by most people who
work in it, they still depend upon comprehensive implementation. They
depend upon elaborate research policies, convenient research tools, and,
not least, the participation of the researchers themselves. In many
instances Open Science appears to be somewhat like the proverbial
electric car—an indeed sensible but expenseful thing which would do
better to be parked in the neighbor’s garage; an idea everybody agrees
upon but urges others to take the first step for.
