## Abstract

In 2005 the German National Library of Science and Technology started
assigning DOI names to datasets to allow stabile linking between
articles and data. In 2009 this work lead to the funding of DataCite, a
global consortium of libraries and information institutions with the aim
to enable scientists to use datasets as independently published records
that can be shared, referenced and cited.

Data integration with text is an important aspect of scientific
collaboration. It allows verification of scientific results and joint
research activities on various aspects of the same problem. Only a very
small proportion of the original data is published in conventional
scientific journals. Existing policies on data archiving
notwithstanding, in today’s practice data are primarily stored in
private files, not in secure institutional repositories, and effectively
are lost to the public. This lack of access to scientific data is an
obstacle to international research. It causes unnecessary duplication of
research efforts, and the verification of results becomes difficult, if
not impossible. Large amounts of research funds are spent every year to
recreate already existing data.

Handling datasets as persistently identified, independently published
items is a key element for allowing citation and long term integration
of datasets into text as well as supporting a variety of data management
activities. It would be an incentive to the author if a data publication
had the rank of a citeable publication, adding to their reputation and
ranking among their peers.

The German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB) developed
and promotes the use of Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) for datasets. A
DOI name is used to cite and link to electronic resources (text as well
as research data and other types of content). The DOI System differs
from other reference systems commonly used on the Internet, such as the
URL, since it is permanently linked to the object itself, not just to
the place in which the object is located. As a major advantage, the use
of the DOI system for registration permits the scientists and the
publishers to use the same syntax and technical infrastructure for the
referencing of datasets that are already established for the referencing
of articles. The DOI system offers persistent links as stable references
to scientific content and an easy way to connect the article with the
underlying data. For example:

The dataset:

    G.Yancheva, N. R. Nowaczyk et al (2007)
    Rock magnetism and X-ray flourescence spectrometry analyses on sediment
    cores of the Lake Huguang Maar, Southeast China, PANGAEA
    doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.587840 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.587840)

Is a supplement to the article:

    G. Ycheva, N. R. Nowaczyk et al (2007)
    Influence of the intertropical convergence zone on the East Asian monsoon
    Nature 445, 74-77 doi:10.1038/nature05431 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature05431)

Since 2005, TIB has been an official DOI Registration Agency with a
focus on the registration of research data. The role of TIB is that of
the actual DOI registration and the storage of the relevant metadata of
the dataset. The research data themselves are not stored at TIB. The
registration always takes place in cooperation with data centers or
other trustworthy institutions that are responsible for quality
assurance, storage and accessibility of the research data and the
creation of metadata.

Access to research data is nowadays defined as part of the national
responsibilities and in recent years most national science organisations
have addressed the need to increase the awareness of, and the
accessibility to, research data.

Nevertheless science itself is international; scientists are involved in
global unions and projects, they share their scientific information with
colleagues all over the world, they use national as well as foreign
information providers.

When facing the challenge of increasing access to research data, a
possible approach should be global cooperation for data access via
national representatives.

- a global cooperation, because scientist work globally, scientific data
are created and accessed globally.
- with national representatives, because most scientists are embedded in
their national funding structures and research organisations .

The key point of this approach is the establishment of a Global DOI
Registration agency for scientific content that will offer to all
researchers dataset registration and cataloguing services. DataCite was
officially launched on December 1st 2009 in London to offer worldwide
DOI-registration of scientific data to actively offer scientists the
possibility to publish their data as an independent citable object.
Currently DataCite has 17 members from 12 countries:

The German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB), the German
National Library of Medicine (ZB MED), the German National Library of
Economics (ZBW) and the German GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social
Sciences. Additional European members are: The Library of the ETH Zürich
in Switzerland, the Library of TU Delft, from the Netherlands, the
L’Institut de l’Information Scientifique et Technique (INIST) from
France, The technical Information Center of Denmark, The British
Library, the Sedish National Data Service (SND), the Conferenza dei
Rettori delle Università Italiane (CRUI) from Italy. North America is
represented through: the California Digital Library, the Office of
Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI), the Purdue University and
the Canada Institute for Scientific and Technical Information (CISTI).
Furthermore the Australian National Data Service (ANDS) and the National
Research Council of Thailand (NRCT) are members.

DataCite offers through its members DOI registration for data centers,
currently over 1.7 million objects have been registered with a DOI name
and are available through [a central search portal at
DataCite](http://search.datacite.org/ui).

Based on the DOI registration DataCite offers a variety of services such
as a detailed statistic portal of the number of DOI names registered and
resolved[^1]. In cooperation with CrossRef, the major DOI registration
agency for scholarly articles a content negotiation service has been
established that allows persistent resolution of all DOI names directly
to their metadata in XML or RDF format[^2].

In June 2012 DataCite and the [STM association](http://stm-assoc.org) signed a joint
statement to encourage publishers and data centers to link articles and
underlying data[^3].
