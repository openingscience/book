abstract: "While Online Publishing has replaced most traditional printed journals
in less than twenty years, today’s Online Publication Formats are still
closely bound to the medium of paper. Collaboration is mostly hidden
from the readership, and ‘final’ versions of papers are stored in
‘publisher PDF’ files mimicking print. Meanwhile new media formats
originating from the web itself bring us new modes of transparent
collaboration, feedback, continued refinement, and reusability of
(scholarly) works: Wikis, Blogs and Code Repositories, to name a few.
This chapter characterizes the potentials of Dynamic Publication Formats
and analyzes necessary prerequisites. Selected tools specific to the
aims, stages, and functions of Scholarly Publishing are presented.
Furthermore, this chapter points out early examples of usage and further
development from the field. In doing so, Dynamic Publication Formats are
described as a) a ‘parallel universe’ based on the commodification of
(scholarly) media, and b) as a much needed complement, slowly recognized
and incrementally integrated into more efficient and dynamic workflows
of production, improvement, and dissemination of scholarly knowledge in
general."

## Introduction

The knowledge creation process is highly dynamic. However, most of
current means of scholarly publications are static, that means, they
cannot be revised over time. Novel findings or results cannot contribute
to the publications once published, instead a new publication has to be
released. Dynamic publication formats will change this. Dynamic
publication formats are bodies of text / graphic / rich media that can
be changed quickly and easily while at the same time being available to
a wide audience.

In this chapter we will discuss dynamic scholarly publication formats
with respect to their chances, advantages, and challenges. First, we
begin with a revision of existing and past publishing concepts. We
discuss how the growing body of scholarly knowledge was updated and
evolved using static forms of publishing. This will be followed by a
structured analysis of the characteristics of dynamic publication
formats, followed by a presentation of currently implemented solutions
that employ concepts of dynamic publications.

## Historic Dynamic Publishing Using Printed Journals and Books: Revising Editions or Publishing Novel Books and Articles

For centuries scholarly books were improved and updated with new
content. This happened through releasing new editions. In subsequent
editions, mistakes were corrected, recent results incorporated, and
feedback from the readership used to improve the overall book. A
sufficient demand for the reprinting of editions was a necessity. Before
reprinting the publisher invited the author to revise the next edition
(‘revised editions’[^1]). The changes were usually marked and introduced
in the preface of the consecutive editions.

Many encyclopedias, handbooks, and schoolbooks became established
brands, which have been revised over and over again, sometimes over the
space of decades. In many examples the authors changed. In successive
revisions parts were changed, paragraphs rewritten, and chapters removed
or added. In particularly vivid fields a different ‘genre’ of book—the
loose-paper-collections—were invented. Here, carefully revised pages
were sent out to subscribers on a regular basis.

Libraries provided not only access to the most recent version of books,
but also kept earlier editions for interested readers. Earlier editions
were of historical and
[epistemological](http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&p=DOKJAA&search=epistemological&trestr=0x8004)
interest.

Recurrent book editions made it necessary to add the consecutive edition
number when referencing revised books.

Revising books allowed authors to keep track with novel developments. A
book usually presented a closed ‘body of knowledge’, a mere collection
of indisputable knowledge, often with a review character. Textbooks or
encyclopedias were specially structured books.

In contrast to books, scholarly articles were a snapshot of certain
scientific knowledge. In most scholarly fields, research results were
published only once. Scientific journal articles were not to be
revised—if new findings occurred, new articles were published.
Publishing became the currency of research and around the journal
article methods to measure the performance of researchers were
developed.

The scholarly journal article and its ‘life cycle’ are currently under
debate and development. New mechanisms to publish scientific results are
being widely discussed; most opportunities have been opened up by the
new possibilities that were enabled by the Internet.

Some of the most prominent changes that have already found wide
acceptance so far are being reviewed in the following:

## Preprint, Postprint and (Open) Peer Review

The fundamental interest of researchers is to publish their research
results in a straightforward fashion. This is in conflict with the
publishers’ duties of filtering good research from faulty research,
rejecting papers with methods that are insufficient to draw the stated
conclusion, or denying research publication that are out of the scope of
the journal’s audience. The current gold standard supporting editorial
decisions is the peer-review process as organized by the publishers.
Since the peer-review process takes a significant amount of time and is
one of the main causes of delaying publications, some research
disciplines developed a culture of publishing so-called *preprints*'''.
'''Preprints are preliminary, pre-peer-review versions of original
research articles which are submitted to repositories such as arXiv
(arxiv.org). It is acceptable to exchange preliminary versions with
updates, for example updates with applied changes that occur during
peer-review, but older versions are always available and cannot be
removed. A publication identifier points to the most recent version of
the article, but older versions can be assessed through a history
function. Preprints are legally accepted by most journals. Some journals
even combine the acceptance with preprints together with an open
peer-review process in which all comments and changes can be tracked
(Pöschl 2012). *Postprints* are versions of the article which are
published after peer-review, usually by storing the article in
repositories (see Chapter 09, Sitek et. al: Open Access: A State of the
Art) or by sending them via email. They contain all the changes that
have resulted from discourse with the peer-reviewers.

## Follow-Ups and Retractions

Publishing preprints, postprints, or even the peer-review process allows
the tracking of the development of a final version of a scholarly
article. Usually, after peer-review, a final version of an article
exists which must not be further changed.

After publication of the article, it is of interest to see how the
article is being received by the community. Its impact is measured by
counting the amount of citations to it, references which result at
article-level (see chapter 12, Fenner et al: Altmetrics and other
measures for scientific impact). Databases such as the Web of Science,
Scopus, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, and non-commercial services such
as Inspire count these citations and provide more meta-analysis of
articles. References to the article are visible and so follow-up
articles can be identified. Current databases do not give information
about the context of a citation. It remains unclear as to whether the
article is referenced as a citation within the introduction, a reference
to similar ‘Material and Methods’, or whether the cited article is being
disputed in the discussion.

In cases of scientific misconduct, articles are retracted. Obviously,
this happens more and more often (cf. Rice 2013). Similarly,
universities retract dissertations and other scientific publications.
Obviously, printed or downloaded articles cannot disappear in the same
way that online version of articles can be deleted. Libraries and
repositories keep the retracted books, articles, or dissertations in the
archives and just change the catalogue status to ‘retracted’. Publishers
delete the online version and books are no longer sold.

## Current Aspects of the Publication System in Regard to the Dynamic Knowledge Creation Process

### The production process is not visible to the reader

With the advancement of the Internet, methods to cooperatively compile a
text (‘collaborative authoring tools’) are finding wider application. It
is now possible to trace each individual’s contribution to a text.
Technically, it would be possible to track all versions and comments
that occur during the production process. Currently, final versions of
scholarly publications do not contain traces of their production
process. The final version of a publication is a kind of finalized
consent from all its authors without any traces of the production
process itself.

### The contribution of individual authors is not visible

Usually contributors to a scientific publication are stated in the list
of authors. Large research organizations provide guidelines on the
requirements to qualify as an author of an article. Only contributors
should be listed as authors and there exist guidelines of good
scientific practice so as to clarify what acceptable contributions are.
Honorary authorships, e.g. authorships that are based on political
considerations, are not considered appropriate[^2]. The listing itself
happens independently of the quantifiable amount of actual text
contribution. However, often the placement and order of the authors give
a hint on the amount and of the kind of contribution. Various cultures
exist; in many disciplines (e.g. life sciences) the first and the last
authors contributed most significantly to an article.

The distribution of third party funding is more and more based upon
scientometric measurements which depend on authorship. Since the
incentives are set that way, it is now very important to a researcher to
have his contribution appropriately acknowledged. In this context,
conventions on the good scientific practice guiding authorship
qualifications have become much more important than in earlier times.
This is especially true in the context of growing author lists and
increasing manipulations. In practice, the distribution of authorship
positions is a complex process, often involving a non-transparent system
of social and professional dependencies.

### Finalized versions do not allow changes, thus making corrections and additions nearly impossible

Despite the fact that the Internet allows for other procedures, the
publication of a scholarly manuscript is organized around the release
date of the publication. After the release of a scientific publication
no corrections, additions, or changes are possible. Only in strong cases
of scientific misconduct, falsicification or manipulation of findings
will a retraction occur, usually with sweeping consequences for the
authors in question. Minor mistakes cannot be corrected. Only a couple
of journals provide online commenting functionality and these are not
currently being used in a relevant matter. However, this might change
quite soon, for example by merging in trackback functions as already
used by weblogs. A scientific discourse around a publication cannot
occur, and if so, channels such as comments or discussion forums are
being used which are currently not credited. Only the discussion
sections of new peer-reviewed publications are a chance for accredited
scholarly criticism.

![**Figure 1**. Today’s scientific publications are static—meaning finalized
versions exist that cannot be changed. Dynamic publication formats have
become possible with the Internet. The publication can now evolve with
the development of new knowledge. In dynamic publications many parts and
texts can be ‘reused’ (as represented by the parts of the text that keep
the color; new additions represent novel scientific knowledge).](/images/dynamic_publication_formats.jpg)

### Redundancy in scientific publications—currently no reuse and remixing

The scientific knowledge creation process is usually incremental. Once a
certain amount of scientific knowledge is gathered, a novel publication
is released. Depending on discipline, a full paper, thesis, or book is
the most accepted form of publication. Each release is considered to be
a self-contained body of text, understandable to fellow-scientists in
the field. This makes redundancy in the introduction, material, and
methods a necessity. With this come certain legal and ethical
implications. The authors are currently in danger of not only being
accused of self-plagiarism, but also of copying from fellow scientists.
Even if sections are correctly referenced and citations are placed, many
scientists reword phrases for fear of being accused of plagiarism and
scientific misconduct. Current conventions prevent scientific authors
from *reusing* well-worded introductions or other paragraphs, despite
the fact that from a truly scientific point of view, this would be
totally acceptable if enough new content and results besides the copied
and reused parts is present (Figure 1). Also, obvious *remixing*'''
'''of phrases and content from several sources is currently not accepted
(Figure 2). This results in unnecessary rewording, a greater workload,
and potentially sub-optimal phrasing. The same introduction, methodology
description, and statements are rewritten over and over again, making it
sometimes difficult to identify the truly new contribution to a
scientific field (Mietchen et al. 2011). It is important to notice that
in many disciplines and scientific cultures, mainly humanities, textual
reproduction with precious words and in a
[literary](http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&p=DOKJAA&search=literary&trestr=0x8004)
manner is a considerable feat which is beyond the pure transportation of
information. Here, the reusing and remixing of content has to be seen in
a different context.

![**Figure 2**. Remixing is the concept of using text and parts of earlier
publications to build a novel publication; remixing is currently
restricted through legal and scientific cultures, however, remixing may
become much more acceptable in the future—remixing has to be
distinguished from scientific plagiarism.](/images/dynamic_publication_formats_2.png)

### Legal hurdles to make remixing and reuse difficult

Most publishers retain the copyright of a publication, which strictly
limits the reuse of text, pictures, and media. This banishment of
remixing seems outdated in the age of the Internet. Novel copyright
concepts such as Creative Commons (CC-BY) (see chapter 19, Friesike:
Case: Creative Commons) will change this and will make reuse and
remixing possible.

### Technical hurdles in reusing content—“Publisher PDF” files are mimicking print

Some scientific publications are being reproduced in a way that makes
the reuse of articles and parts of articles technically difficult.
Sometimes, the PDF version is the only available version of an article.
More open formats, such as HTML, XML, LaTeX source code, or word
documents are not always released and remain with the publisher. Even
the author themself suffers from significant hurdles in accessing the
final version of his or her personal publications (cf. Schneider 2011;
Wikiversity[^3]).

The current publication system is a consequence of a scholarly knowledge
dissemination system which developed in times before the Internet when
printing and disseminating printed issues of papers were the only means
of distributing scientific results. The Internet made it possible to
break with the limitations of printed publications and allowed the
development of dynamic publication formats.

## Dynamic Publication Format — General Concept

Science as a whole is constantly developing. Novel insights, results,
and data are permanently being found. The prevailing current publication
system is dynamic, but its changes and iterations are too slow. The
publication system developed long before the Internet. With the Internet
came new possibilities for publishing, transporting results, and
defining the nature of ‘a publication’. Dynamic publications can adapt
to the development of knowledge. Just as Wikipedia is developing towards
completeness and truth, why not have scientific publications that
develop in pace with the body of scientific knowledge?

### Dynamic publication — challenges

In the past a modality of publication was mainly shaped by the
prevailing medium (paper) and its distribution (mailing). New scientific
results had to cross a certain threshold to be publishable. This
threshold was defined by the amount of effort that was necessary to
produce this publication and to distribute it. A publication had to be
somewhat consistent and comprehensible by itself. The forms of
publications that were available in the past are abstracts, talks,
papers, reviews, and books (Figure 3).

![**Figure 3**. Classical publication formats before the Internet.](/images/dynamic_publication_formats_3.png)

Since the Internet, the available publication methods are no longer
limited to this list. It became possible that virtually everybody can
publish at very little or no cost. The limiting factor of the medium of
paper and its distribution vanished. Novel publication methods such as
blogs, microblogs, comments, wiki updates, or other publication methods
complement the prevailing publishing methods (Figure 4) (Pochoda 2012).

![**Figure 4**. Today’s publication formats.](/images/dynamic_publication_formats_4.png)

## Aspects of Dynamic Publication Formats

### Dynamic

Dynamic publication formats are—as the name says—dynamic (Figure 5),
meaning that no static version exists. Dynamic publications evolve. The
changes can be done on several formal levels, from letters and single
words (‘collaborative authoring tools’, ‘wikis’), to a few sentences
(‘status updates’) and whole paragraphs (‘blogs’, ‘comments’). Changes
include deletions, changes, and additions. However, implementations vary
in terms of how permanent a deletion may be.

### Authorship

In collaborative authoring tools it is quite technically easy to
precisely trace who typed which text and who drew which figures.
However, authorship in a scientific publication currently represents
much more than just an actual textual contribution. It defines whose
ideas and theories lead to it, in addition to the actual work that was
necessary to gather the scientific results. This is not adequately
represented by the actual contribution of the text. Authorship is a
guarantor of quality and here the personal reputation of a researcher is
at stake. Therefore, clear statements of the kind of contribution to a
work provided by an author should be associated with a publication. For
example, many scientific journals request a definition of the role each
author played in the production process of the work. The contributions
range from the basic idea and actual bench work to revision of the
article.

### Openness

Technically the whole textual creation process including all typing and
editing could be open. Furthermore, all commentary and discussion can be
open. Certain consequences are related to such openness. Not all
versions of a document and discussions are meant to be public. While
openness can be seen as a tool for assuring quality and preventing
scientific misconduct, at the same time it puts researchers under great
pressure. Usually early versions of documents are full of spelling
mistakes and errors and not meant to be seen by the public; furthermore,
they usually lack approval from all coauthors.

A possible solution allows for some parts of the publication and editing
process to take place with limited visibility in a *working version*.
After all authors have approved a version or a revision, this version
can become part of the *public version* (Figure 5). The step from
working version to public version would be based on some internal
‘gatekeeping’ criteria, such as the discussion and consent of all
authors, making the process similar to that of the peer-review process.
However, the peer-review is done by people other than the authors
themselves and the peer-reviewing process can be organized by a
quality-granting authority such as a journal.

![**Figure 5**. Dynamic publications: Working and public versions. The
working versions are collaboratively edited by a small group of authors.
The authors can decide when a version or a revision should become widely
available. Depending on the platform, a formalized ‘gate-keeping’
mechanism (consent among authors) and/or ‘peer-review’ as organized by a
quality-granting authority (journal) has to be passed. Working as well
as published versions can be reused by other authors.](/images/dynamic_publication_formats_5.jpg)

### Tranclusion, pull-requests, and forking—Lifecycle and history

The lifecycle of a dynamic publication is much harder to define than the
life cycle of a static, traditional publication. Concepts such as
*‘transclusion’*[^4], *‘pull-requests’*, and *‘forking’*[^5] allow for
different kinds of *remixing* and *'reuse'* of earlier
publications (Figure 6). An important feature of dynamic publications is
the availability of a history functionality so that older versions of
the publication are still available and referencing to the older
versions can occur. This might not only be of interest to historians of
science, but may also be very valuable in assessing the merits of
earlier scientific discoveries and documenting scientific disputes.

Many of these remixing and reuse concepts stem from collaborative
software development and many of these are in turn far removed from the
current perception of the life cycle of scientific publications. It
remains to be seen whether they can be integrated into the scientific
publishing culture so that the systems in question benefit from it, and
usability, as well as readability, can be assured.

![**Figure 6**. Dynamic publications allow many novel concepts such as
‘forking’ (dividing one publication into two branches of working
versions), ‘transclusion’ (reuse of text or images from another
publication, potentially with live updates) and ‘pull requests’ (a
certain way of including updates from one forked working version into
another: a ‘one time transclusion’).](/images/dynamic_publication_formats_6.jpg)

## Publication formats

Various publication formats exist. There are books, chapters, abstracts,
tweets, reviews, full-papers, and so on. Some publication formats are
more likely to benefit from the many remixing concepts of dynamic
publications than others. In many science cultures, reviews are
constantly being released on similar topics, sometimes on an annual
basis. A dynamic publication concept would be ideally suited to
providing reviews of current developments: instead of publishing
completely novel reviews, reviews could constantly be updated.

### Content and quality control

The authors as the primary guarantors of quality remain untouched by the
concepts of dynamic publications. However, while the pre-publication
peer-review of static publications and the decision of editorial boards
or publishers assured content in the past, this is more flexible in
dynamic publications. An open commenting functionality can be seen as a
form of post-publication review. The public pressure that is associated
with potentially unmasking comments urges the authors to provide a high
standard of output. If the commenting functionality is anonymous it
should be clear to all readers that non-qualified comments may occur; at
the same time, an anonymous commenting functionality may encourage true
criticisms.

In actual implementations of dynamic publications, visibility of
transclusions as well as pull-requests has to be assured—otherwise
misunderstanding of the actual authorship may occur.

### Cultural background

Dynamic publications are a completely novel tool in scholarly
publishing. Scientists have to learn to use them and to understand their
benefits and limitations. Furthermore, scientometrics have to learn how
to assess contributions that occur in dynamic publications.

Some research fields are more suited to dynamic publication concepts,
while others are less so. There are research cultures that might
implement dynamic publications faster than others. Hard sciences/lab
sciences are more suited for dynamic publications. Here, often novel,
incremental findings just require small changes to a text, whereas in
humanities comprehensive theories and interpretations might not be as
suitable to be expressed in well-circumscribed changes of text.

## Current Implementation of Dynamic Publications

Traditional scholarly publication methods exist – and novel tools and
platforms that technically allow the realization of dynamic publication
concepts have originated from the web. Tools that implement aspects of
dynamic publishing are presented here and in Table 1 and their
limitations explained.

### Journal Articles and Books

Journal articles and books represent the gold-standard of scientific
publishing. In the world of books and journal articles there exists a
point in time that clearly divides the production phase from the
reception phase of a scientific publication. This point in time is when
the publication is released and available to readers. With this comes
the expectation that the results and discussion of released scientific
results provided are ‘complete’ and ‘final’. When the neutral and often
anonymous peer-review process is finished, a publication is ‘fit to
print’[^6]. In most scientific cultures, it is not expected that something
should be published before the peer-review is concluded. The production
process is usually only open to the work group and authors. This is
being changed through the use of Preprint-Repositories (like arXive.org
(since 1991)), or the opening of the peer-review process in some
journals (cf. Pöschl 2012). After peer-review critical comments,
extensions, hints, and reviews have to go to other publications.

### Blogs

Blogs are fundamentally different: Only the author decides on the
medium, the structure of publication, and the point in time of the
release. Usually blogs are produced by single persons and even in the
case of blogging platforms the responsibility for the content of one
blog usually rests with the author of that explicit blog. This results
in certain expectations with respect to the content of the blog. In
typical scientific blogs, scientists publish reviews and review-like
aggregations of already published scientific publications. Blogs can
often be seen as a method of science journalism. On the other hand, some
scientists blog about their ongoing research, e.g. about the progress of
a doctoral thesis (cf. Efimova 2009). In some cases a blog is a public
form of the scientific knowledge creation process—the blog becomes a
diary of the personal knowledge creation process, with novel ideas and
results being constantly published. Even preliminary results and
unproven hypotheses can be presented to a limited audience (limited in
terms of real readers—most blogs are indeed completely open) which, on
the other hand, provides useful feedback in the form of comments or
other feedback. In this context, a blog post is usually based on earlier
blog posts and it is not considered to be a ‘full publication’ with
sufficient background information. A high level of very specialized
knowledge is assumed (also see the discussion round including Mike
Taylor; Taylor, 2012). In conclusion, it could be said that blog
postings are no replacement for, but rather a useful adjunct to
old-fashioned, peer-reviewed journal or book publications. Blog postings
seem to already be on their trajectory to become a valuable part of the
publication mix. (Cf. to the development around the project
ScienceSeeker[^7].)

### Wikis

While blog postings represent conclusive texts of individual authors,
wikis are much more different from traditional ways of publishing. Wikis
were initially introduced to document practices for developing
software[^8], however, they became commonly known through the open and freely
available online encyclopedia “Wikipedia” (wikipedia.org, since 2001).
Wikis represent websites with content that can be collaboratively
changed by potentially very large groups of users. Despite the fact that
the usage of wikis grew far beyond the remit of software development and
encyclopedias, Wikipedia significantly influenced the wide reception of
wikis.

Wikis are hosted as open platforms in the public web. In most cases, a
registration for the wiki is easily possible and new wiki topics can be
proposed from anyone, while the triage of new articles or concurrent
changes and their acceptation to the public version of wiki is done by
the project founders or a special user group of the wiki. Usually, these
are authors who have become especially trustworthy through their
engagement with, or past contributions to the wiki. Usually the founding
group provides style and content guidelines. Strict adherence to these
guidelines is especially relevant since the content of articles is more
or less implicitly approved of by all authors of the wiki community. To
resolve disputes is particularly challenging since only one version of
the articles exists. If disputes are unsolvable usually all views are
elucidated and the reason for the dispute is mentioned.

The fact that many people can contribute to articles possesses the
advantage that virtually anybody can become a co-author. Errors and
biased viewpoints can be corrected much quicker than in traditional ways
of publishing. This is under the assumption that all contributors adhere
to the consensus of the wiki—potentially at the expense of personal
writing styles and viewpoints.

The individual author has to accept that statements might be edited or
modified by the community. Similarly, he has to accept its principles of
meritocracy and the potential consequences that might arise from such
principles.

On the other side, contributions to a continuously evolving wiki-project
present the possibility of contributing to a work with an ongoing
relevance. Even far into the future, relevant contributions by an
individual author can be traced in detail in the revision history of the
wiki text. This might also be used to scientometrically quantify the
quality or relevance of contributions to wikis—for example current
approaches include algorithmic modeling of the revision history (Kramer
et al. 2008).

In contrast to scientific blogging and some dedicated wiki-projects,
Wikipedia itself was never considered to be a platform to exchange
originary research results. Wikipedia keeps an encyclopedic character,
however, despite this, there are multiple examples of scientists who
actively contribute to Wikipedia. Ever more so, some academic
organizations propose a lively contribution to Wikipedia (Farzan & Kraut
2012).

A cointegration of a scientific journal and Wikipedia was started with
*Topic Pages* by *PLoS Computational Biology* (Wodak et al. 2012).
Topic Pages are a version of a page to be posted to (the English
version of) Wikipedia. In other words, PLoS Computational Biology
publishes a version that is static, includes author attributions, and is
indexed in PubMed, all with the reviews and reviewer identities of Topic
Pages available to the readership. The aim of this project is that the
Wikipedia pages subsequently become living documents which will be
updated and enhanced by the Wikipedia community.

### Stack Exchange—message boards where threads are initiated by posting open questions

Question centered message boards (“stack exchange”) like *MathOverflow*
and *BioStar* (Parnell et al. 2011) consists of comment threads that
are posted under a known ID. A thread is centered on a question, which
is in contrast to blogs which provide more or less opinions, reviews,
comments, overviews, or novel hypotheses. A reputation (‘Karma’) can be
built by earning ‘likes’ or ‘views’ from other users within the
community (initially introduced by *Slashdot* in the 90s). The
questioner and the community (Paul et al. 2012) assesses as to whether
the answers are sufficient and whether the thread should be closed,
maximizing the potential gain in Karma. The incentives set by this leads
to many useful and comprehensible answers at the end of a good
browseable question thread. Orienting threads around questions leads to
a question-centered discussion and the discussions in turn stay on
topic.

### SNS for scientists

Social networking systems (SNS) have found widespread use in the
Internet. Early examples are Friendster, Sixdegrees.com, Myspace, while
Facebook made the concept widely available. In 2012 Facebook hit the
first billion of users worldwide. After signing in to a SNS, users can
set up a profile page with a multitude of information about themselves.
Besides adopting the information, posting so-called ‘status updates’ has
become very popular, ranging from personal feelings to more or less
useful information on one’s current task or whereabouts, often together
with some rich media such as pictures or movies.

Other users can follow the status update of particular members. Members
that are ‘followed’ contribute to their own personal ‘timeline’—a
collection of all status updates of fellow members. Other users can be
added to the list of friends. Friending another user results in a mutual
exchange of status updates, media, pictures, and many more things.

Usually, all friendship and follower connections are visible to a wider
audience. This fact, together with many other aspects of proprietary
SNS, resulted in privacy concerns which the provider tried to counteract
by establishing selective privacy settings. Other SNS such as Twitter
incorporated a full and mandatory openness into their strategy. With the
advancement of SNS users are becoming more and more aware of the chances
and dangers of SNS’s.

Most SNS’s create a rich social experience with a mixture of status
updates from friends, personalized news, and the possibility of
interacting with the postings of others by ‘liking’ or commenting on
them. If the user decides that certain postings might be of interest to
their friends or followers, they can share it with them—often with the
click of a mouse button.

Dedicated SNS’s for scientists were established around 2008 (see chapter
07, Nentwich et al: Academia Goes Facebook? The Potential of Social
Network Sites in the Scholarly Realm). Scientists started to share
status updates related to their scientific work, in many cases
information about published articles, abstracts, and talks. They provide
a platform for users to post their research articles in compliance with
copyright laws, since a profile page is considered to be a personal
homepage (Green road to open access (**see chapter 09, Sitek et al: Open
Access: A State of the Art)**). More and more often, scientists have
started to take the opportunity to incorporate media as well as some
interesting, novel findings into their status updates. The providers use
information and connections between users to support scientists, using
suggestions about interesting topics, other publications, and fellow
researchers that work in similar fields. Mendeley, Academia.edu, and
Researchgate.org have reached several millions of users.

Most users of SNS’s for scientists maintain a profile in a
non-scientific SNS. At the dawn of the SNS, it seemed like there was
only need for one SNS that could serve all personal, professional, and
scientific (and many more) networking needs. However, this impression
was wrong. It seems to be more suitable for users to maintain several
profiles in several SNS’s, whereof the facets of the personal profile as
well as the shared information depends on the purpose of the SNS
[@nentwich_cyberscience_2012]. Users do not want to mix holiday pictures with
their scientific publications.

In the past, SNS’s were not considered to be a means of sharing original
scientific results. However, this may undergo profound changes. For
example, in 2011, FigShare (a commercial service) was introduced,
serving as a free repository for the archiving and presentation of
scientific results. Researchgate as well as Mendeley allow the
publication of preprints; Mendeley allows the finding of dedicated
reviewers for certain publications.

SNS’s carry the potential of becoming a means of publishing scientific
results in accordance with the ongoing decoupling of scientific
communication channels from the journal system [@priem_altmetrics_2012].

The status updates in SNS’s for scientists could be used to publish
ideas, exciting findings, as well as links to other interesting sources.
Commenting, as well as the ‘like’ functionality could act as a kind of
peer-review. In SNS’s for scientists, status updates, comments, and
likes are not anonymously done—therefore their creator together with
their profile are visible to other scientists who can then assess the
‘credibility’ and the background of the contributing scientists. The
‘question’ functionality of ResearchGate provides a platform with vivid
scientific discussions that were not possible in such a manner, were the
users to hide behind anonymous acronyms.

Furthermore, SNS’s can analyze the activity of scientists and provide
easily accessible, novel ‘impact’ metrics of scientists—based on their
activity and reputation within a SNS or based on established metrics.

A SNS for scientists combined with a text editing and publishing
platform might be the ideal platform to realize a dynamic publication
system.

**Technical reusability**                                                       Potentially possible, but practically limited by PDF format; little use of markup languages and remixing mechanisms such as “forking” or “transclusion”                                Usage of markup languages including HTML; but no implementation of remixing or forking mechanisms                                                                                                                                   Highly reusable; content is highly structured; flexible markup language; transclusion within the platform; easily traceable transclusion                                                                                            Highly reusable; examples for usage of markup languages such as Markdown and Pandoc for text publications; forks easily and often done; traceable

**Legal reusability**                                                           More and more use of more open copyright licenses;                                                                                                                                     Almost only use of open copyright licenses that allow reuse                                                                                                                                                                         Very high; wikipedia-like or creative commons licenses                                                                                                                                                                              Very high; free licenses that allow reuse

**Implementations**                                                             Proprietary journal platforms or open journal platforms such as Open Journal System of public knowledge project (see chapter 11)                                                       WordPress with wide spread use; other blogging solutions                                                                                                                                                                            MediaWiki with wide spread use; proprietary tools such as Google Docs                                                                                                                                                               GitHub or free repository platform Git; Sourceforge or CVS

**History function**                                                            Traces of creation process usually deleted; no history function                                                                                                                        No traces of creation process; no history function                                                                                                                                                                                  Complete traces of creation process and history of articles; seamless traces of discussion                                                                                                                                          Complete traces of creation process and history of articles; seamless traces of discussion

**Openness, in general**                                                        Closed, after publication after paywall/open access                                                                                                                                    Closed until publication than open                                                                                                                                                                                                  Form very beginning open to a wide community                                                                                                                                                                                        Form very beginning open to a wide community

**Readability in style / Redundancy: 1. In the best case**                      Ability to frame a finished research result, in homogenous writing style by one (or a few) author(s).                                                                                  Direct reporting of research results with readability of (good) science journalism.                                                                                                                                                 Capacity for continuous refinement and correction of text; authors allowed to remix / translate from previously existing articles.                                                                                                  Capacity for continuous refinement and correction of text.

**Readability in style / Redundancy: 2. Challenges and problems**               External pressures to ‘publish or perish’ and therefore diluted and dispersed results.                                                                                                 Often “serialized” reporting of ongoing, not yet finished research. As such mostly addressing peers in same research topic area (e.g. by not making clear research aims, presumptions, methods used, etc. in each new blog post).   Hard to maintain consistent encyclopaedia-level content and readability with large author community. In addition, this often leads to wiki-bureaucracy, e.g. meta-level of templates, rules, acceptance of proposed changes, etc.   At present, few experiences with article-style collaborative knowledge production in code repositories; by now mostly used for production / collection / integration of code and data.

                                                                                Compared e.g. to wiki / social coding writing style: unusual to “remix” previously existing text and/or make later corrections in style.

**Acceptance within scientific community**                                      Together with books in most disciplines the essential part of scientific publishing; officially credited                                                                               Somewhat accepted, but most often not credited                                                                                                                                                                                      Widely used, but contribution not credited                                                                                                                                                                                          Used, e.g. for production and maintenance of software code, in some cases data collections / documentation; Most often not credited
